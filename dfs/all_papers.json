For example, Xij can indicate whether or not user i\nhas an interest in product j, and our goal is to segment users and products into relevant\nsubgroups. Alternatively, Xij could be the log activation level of gene j in patient i; our\ngoal is to seek groups of patients with similar genetic profiles, while at the same time finding\ngroups of genes with similar activation levels. The general simultaneous clustering problem is\nknown by many names, including direct clustering (Hartigan, 1972), block modeling (Arabie\net al., 1978), biclustering (Mirkin, 1996), and co-clustering (Dhillon, 2001).\nEmpirical results from a broad range of disciplines indicate that biclustering is useful in\npractice. Ungar and Foster (1998) and Hofmann (1999) found that biclustering helps identify\nstructure in collaborative filtering contexts with heterogeneous users and sparsely-observed\npreferences. Eisen et al. (1998) used microarray data to simultaneously cluster genes and\nconditions, finding that genes with similar functions often cluster together. Harpaz et al. (2010)\napplied biclustering methods to a Food and Drug Adminstration report database, identifying\nassociations between certain active ingredients and adverse medical reactions. Several other\napplications of biclustering exist (Cheng and Church, 2000; Getz et al., 2000; Lazzeroni and\nOwen, 2002; Kluger et al., 2003); Madeira and Oliveira (2004) give a comprehensive survey.\nPractitioners interested in biclustering have used a variety of different algorithms to\nachieve their results. Clearly, many of these algorithms work well in practice, but they\nare often ad-hoc, and there are no rigorous guarantees as to their performance. Without\nthese guarantees practitioners cannot be assured that their discoveries from biclustering will\ngeneralize or be reproducible; collecting more data may lead to completely different clusters.\nThere are two approaches to evaluating the theoretical performance of these procedures.\nThe first is to define a higher-level learning task, and evaluate procedures using a task-\ndependent measure of generalization performance (Seldin and Tishby, 2009, 2010). We instead\nconsider the alternative approach, which is to consider the problem purely as an unsupervised\n2\nlearning task. In this case, the procedure is evaluated based on the identified biclusters, where\na reasonable goal is consistent biclustering.\nOur first contribution is to formalize biclustering as an estimation problem. We do this by\nintroducing a probabilistic model for the data matrix X, where up to permutations of the\nrows and columns, the expectation of X has a block structure. Next, we make distributional\nassumptions on the elements of X and derive a clustering objective function via profile-\nlikelihood (Murphy and van der Vaart, 2000). Finally, we show that the maximum profile\nlikelihood estimator performs well when the distributional assumptions are not satisfied, in\nthe sense that it is still consistent. To our knowledge, this is the first general consistency\nresult for a biclustering algorithm.\nUnfortunately, it is computationally intractable to compute the maximum profile likelihood\nestimator. It is for this reason that Ungar and Foster (1998), who used a similar probabilistic\nmodel for the data matrix, dismissed likelihood-based approaches as computationally infeasible.\nOur second contribution, then, is to propose a new approximation algorithm for finding a local\nmaximizer of the biclustering profile likelihood. Our algorithm is based on the Kernigham-Lin\nheuristic (Kernighan and Lin, 1970), which was employed by Newman (2006) for clustering\nnetwork data. This is a greedy optimization procedure, so it is not guaranteed to find a\nglobal optimum. To mitigate this, we run the fitting procedure repeatedly with many random\ninitializations; as we increase the number of initializations, the probability that the algorithm\nfinds the global optimum increases. We show that this procedure has low computational\ncomplexity and it performs well in practice.\nOur work was inspired by recent developments in clustering methods for symmetric binary\nnetworks. In that context, X is an n-by-n symmetric binary matrix, and the clusters for the\nrows of X are the same as the clusters for the columns of X. Bickel and Chen (2009) used\nmethods similar to those used for proving consistency of M-estimators to derive results for\nnetwork clustering when n tends to infinity. This work was later extended by Choi et al. (2012),\nwho allow the number of clusters to increase with n; Zhao et al. (2011), who allow for nodes\n3\nnot belonging to any cluster; and Zhao et al. (2012), who incorporate individual-specific effects.\nIn parallel to this work, Rohe et al. (2011) study the performance of spectral clustering for\nsymmetric binary networks; and Rohe and Yu (2012) study spectral methods for unsymmetric\nbinary networks.\nIn our report we have extended methods originally developed for an extremely specialized\ncontext (symmetric binary networks) to handle clustering for arbitrary data matrices. Using\nstandard conditions, we have been able to generalize the Bickel and Chen (2009) results\nbeyond Bernoulli random variables. To our knowledge, this is the first time methodologies\nfor binary networks have been used to study general biclustering methods. Notably, our\nextensions can handle a variety of data distributions, and they can handle both dense and\nsparse data matrices.\nThe main text of the paper is organized as follows. First Section 2 describes the theoretical\nsetup and Section 3 presents our main result with a heuristic proof. Then, Section 4 describes\nthe formal theoretical framework and states the rigorous consistency results. Next, Section 5\npresents our approximation algorithm. Using this algorithm, Section 6 corroborates the\ntheoretical findings through a simulation study, and Section 7 presents applications to a\nmicroarray and a congressional voting dataset. Section 8 presents some concluding remarks.\nThe supplementary appendices include additional proofs, empirical results, and an application\nto a movie review dataset.\n2 Estimation problem and criterion functions\nOur first task is to formalize biclustering as an estimation problem. To this end, let X =\n[Xij ] \u2208 Rm\u00d7n be a data matrix. We follow the network clustering literature and posit existence\nof K row classes and L column classes, such that the mean value of entry Xij is determined\nsolely by the classes of row i and column j. That is, there is an unknown row class membership\nvector c \u2208 Km, an unknown column class membership vector d \u2208 Ln, and an unknown\n4\nmean matrix M = [\u00b5kl] \u2208 RK\u00d7L such that\nEXij = \u00b5cidj . (2.1)\nWe refer to model (2.1) as a block model, after the related model for undirected networks\nproposed by Holland et al. (1983). When a block model is in force, biclustering the rows and\ncolumns of the data matrix is equivalent to estimating c and d.\nNot all block models give rise to well-defined estimation problems. To ensure that K\nand L are well-defined, we require that each class has at least one member, and that no two\nclasses have the same mean vector. Formally, define row class proportion vector p \u2208 RK\nwith element pa = m\n\u22121\u2211\ni I(ci = a) equal the proportion of nodes with row class a. Also,\ndefine column class proportion vector q \u2208 RL with element qb = n\u22121\n\u2211\nj I(dj = b) equal to\nthe proportion of nodes with column class b. We require that every element of p and q be\nnonzero. To ensure that the mean vectors of the row classes are distinct, we require that no\ntwo rows of M are identical. Similarly, we require that no two columns of M are identical.\nWe estimate the clusters by assigning labels to the rows and columns of X, codified in\nvectors g \u2208 Km and h \u2208 Ln. Ideally, g and h match c and d. Note we are assuming that the\ntrue numbers of row and column clusters, K and L, are known, or they have been correctly\nestimated by some model selection procedure. We measure the performance of a particular\nlabel assignment through the corresponding confusion matrix. Specifically, for row and column\nlabel assignments g and h, define normalized confusion matrices C \u2208 RK\u00d7K and D \u2208 RL\u00d7L\nby\nCak =\n1\nm\n\u2211\ni\nI(ci = a, gi = k), Dbl =\n1\nn\n\u2211\nj\nI(dj = b, hj = l).\nEntry Cak is the proportion of nodes with class a and label k; entry Dbl is defined similarly.\nThese matrices are normalized so that C1 = p and D1 = q are the class proportion vectors,\nand CT1 = p\u02c6 and DT1 = q\u02c6 are the label proportion vectors. If C and D are diagonal, then\nthe assigned labels match the true classes. More generally, if C and D can be made diagonal\n5\nby permuting their columns, then the partition induced by the labels matches the partition\ninduced by the classes. The goal, then, is to find row and column labellings such that C and\nD are permutations of diagonal matrices.\nIn practice, we cannot estimate C and D directly, because we do not have knowledge of\nthe true row and column classes. To evaluate the quality of a biclustering, we need a surrogate\ncriterion function. Analogously to Bickel and Chen (2009), we employ profile-likelihood for\nthis purpose.\nIn Bickel and Chen\u2019s setting, the data are binary, so there is a natural data likelihood\nwhich arises from the Bernoulli distribution. Our setting is more general, with X ij allowed\nto be a count or a continuous measurement, so there are many possible choices for the\nelement densities. We proceed by initially assuming that the elements of X are sampled\nfrom distributions in a single-parameter exponential family. Conditional on c and d, the\nelements of X are independent, and entry Xij has density g(x; \u03b7cidj) with respect to some\nbase measure \u03bd, where\ng(x; \u03b7) = exp{x\u03b7 \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b7)};\n\u03c8(\u03b7) is the cumulant generating function, and \u03b7kl = (\u03c8\n\u2032)\u22121(\u00b5kl) is the natural parameter.\nLater, we will relax the assumption of the specific distributional form.\nWith labels g and h, the complete data log-likelihood is\nl(g,h,M ) =\n\u2211\nk,l\n\u2211\ni,j\n{Xij\u03b7kl \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b7kl)} I(gi = k, hj = l)\n= mn\n\u2211\nk,l\np\u02c6k q\u02c6l {X\u00afkl \u03b7kl \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b7kl)},\nwhere p\u02c6k = m\n\u22121\u2211\ni I(gi = k) and q\u02c6l = n\n\u22121\u2211\nj I(hj = l) are the estimated class proportions\nand X\u00afkl = {\n\u2211\ni,j I(gi = k, hj = l)}\u22121\n\u2211\ni,j Xij I(gi = k, hj = l) is the estimated cluster mean.\nWe get the profile log-likelihood by maximizing the log-likelihood over the mean parameter\n6\nmatrix M :\npl(g,h) = sup\nM\nl(g,h,M ) = mn\n\u2211\nk,l\np\u02c6k q\u02c6l \u03c8\n\u2217(X\u00afkl),\nwhere \u03c8\u2217(x) = sup\u03b7{x\u03b7 \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b7)} is the convex conjugate of \u03c8. We refer to \u03c8\u2217 as the relative\nentropy function since \u03c8\u2217(\u00b5) is equal to the Kullback-Leiber divergence of the base measure \u03bd\nfrom the distribution in the exponential family with mean \u00b5 (Brown, 1986).\nFollowing the above derivation, a natural criterion for the quality of labeling (g,h) is\nthe profile log-likelihood pl(g,h). In the sequel, we consider a far more general setting. We\nconsider criterion functions of the form\nF (g,h) =\n\u2211\nk,l\np\u02c6k q\u02c6l f(X\u00afkl), (2.2)\nwhere f is any smooth convex function. Following the derivation above, we refer to F as a\nprofile likelihood and we refer to f as the corresponding relative entropy function. However,\nwe do not assume that likelihood has been correctly specified. In particular, as long as the\nblock model (2.1) is in force, the elements of X can have arbitrary distributional forms, not\nnecessarily belonging to any exponential family. We explicitly allow for heteroscedasticity and\ndistributional misspecification. We show that under mild technical conditions, the maximizer\nof F is a consistent estimator of the true row and column classes.\n3 Heuristic justification\nIn Section 2, we defined a formal biclustering estimation problem and we motivated a class of\ncriterion functions for this problem based on profile likelihood. In this section, we investigate\nthe behavior of the criterion functions. In particular, we outline a heuristic argument which\nshows that the row and column labels found by maximizing these criterion functions are good\nestimates of the true row and column classes. Formal statements of the results and their\nproofs are given in Section 4 and Supplement A.\n7\nAs noted in Section 1, the main thrust of our theoretical results are similar to that used in\nthe literature on clustering for symmetric binary networks initiated by Bickel and Chen (2009)\nand extended by Choi et al. (2012), Zhao et al. (2011) and Zhao et al. (2012). The main\npoint of departure from this previous work are that we work with arbitrary data modalities\ninstead of symmetric binary matrices.\nLet X \u2208 Rm\u00d7n be a data matrix drawn from an identifiable block model (2.1) with row\nand column classes c \u2208 Km and d \u2208 Ln and mean matrix M \u2208 RK\u00d7L. Let p, and q be as\ndefined in Section 2. For any row and column labeling g and h, let p\u02c6, q\u02c6, and X\u00af be the\ncorresponding estimates of p, q, and M , and let C and D be the confusion matrices. Let\nF be a profile likelihood criterion function as in (2.2) with corresponding relative entropy\nfunction f , assumed to be smooth and strictly convex.\nWe now outline a series of results which show that the maximizers of F are good estimates\nof the true row and column classes.\nProposition 3.1. The criterion function F is uniformly close to a \u201cpopulation criterion\nfunction\u201d G which only depends on the confusion matrices.\nIf n and m are large, then for any choice of g and h, the estimated cluster mean X\u00afkl will\nbe close to Ekl, the average value of EXij over the block defined by labels k and l. This\nquantity can be computed in terms of the confusion matrices as\nEkl =\n\u2211\ni,j\n\u2211\na,b \u00b5ab I(ci = a, gi = k) I(dj = b, hj = l)\u2211\ni,j I(gi = k, hj = l)\n=\n[CT MD]kl\n[CT1]k[D\nT1]l\n.\nBy applying Bernstein\u2019s inequality, one can show that Ekl is close to X\u00afkl uniformly over all\nchoices of g and h. Thus, we get the population criterion function by replacing X\u00afkl with Ekl.\nFor each non-negative vector t \u2208 RN+ define Ct to be the set of N \u00d7N normalized confusion\nmatrices with fixed row sums: Ct = {W \u2208 RN\u00d7N+ : W1 = t}. The population version of F is\n8\na function of the row and column confusion matrices, G : Cp \u00d7 Cq \u2192 R, with\nG(C,D) =\n\u2211\nk,l\n[CT1]k [D\nT1]l f\n( [CTMD]kl\n[CT1]k [D\nT1]l\n)\n.\nSince X\u00afkl is uniformly close to Ekl, under mild regularity conditions on f , the criterion F (g,h)\nis uniformly close to G(C,D). Proposition ?? (Supplement A) contains a rigorous statement\nof this result.\nProposition 3.2. The population criterion function G is self-consistent.\nSelf-consistency is an important property for any criterion function, which implies that\nin the absence of noise, the criterion function will be maximized at the truth (Tarpey and\nFlury, 1996). In our context, self-consistency means that G is maximized when C and D are\npermutations of diagonal matrices.\nThe self-consistency of G follows from the strict convexity of f :\nG(C,D) =\n\u2211\nk,l\n[CT1]k [D\nT1]l f\n( [CTMD]kl\n[CT1]k [D\nT1]l\n)\n\u2264\n\u2211\nk,l\n\u2211\na,b\nCakDblf(\u00b5ab)\n=\n\u2211\na,b\npa qb f(\u00b5ab).\nIf M has no two identical rows and no two identical columns, then exact equality holds only\nwhen C and D are permutations of diagonal matrices. Thus, G is maximized when the row\nand column class partitions match the label partitions. Proposition ?? (Supplement A) gives\na refined self-consistency result with a more complete characterization of the behavior of G\nnear its maxima.\nProposition 3.3. Under enough regularity, the maximizer of the criterion function F is\nclose to the true row and column class partition.\n9\nThis is a direct consequence of Propositions 3.1 and 3.2. The criterion F is uniformly\nclose to the population criterion G, and G is maximized at the true class partitions. Thus,\nthe maximizer of F is close to the maximizer of G. Importantly, Proposition 3.3 does\nnot require any distributional assumptions on the data matrix X beyond its expectation\nsatisfying the block model. In particular this result can be applied to binary matrices, count\ndata, and continuous data. Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 contain precise statements analogous to\nProposition 3.3.\n4 Rigorous Theoretical Results\nHere we provide formal statements of the main result from Section 3. The proofs of these\nresults are contained in Supplement A\nWe work in an asymptotic framework, where the dimensions of the data matrix tend to\ninfinity. Let Xn \u2208 Rm\u00d7n be a sequence of data matrices indexed by n, with m = m(n) and\nm(n)\u2192\u221e as n\u2192\u221e. We will also suppose that n/m\u2192 \u03b3 for some finite constant \u03b3 > 0;\nthis assumption is not essential, but it simplifies the assumption and result statements.\nSuppose that for each n there exists a row class membership vector cn \u2208 Km and a column\nclass membership vector dn \u2208 Ln. We assume that there exist vectors p \u2208 RK and q \u2208 RL\nsuch that p\u02c6k(c)\u2192 pk and q\u02c6l(d)\u2192 ql as n\u2192\u221e almost surely for all k and l; this assumption\nis satisfied, for example, if the class labels are independently drawn from a multinomial\ndistribution. When there is no ambiguity, we omit the subscript n.\nWe define the mean matrix M = [\u00b5kl] \u2208 RK\u00d7L as in Section 3, but allow it to possibly vary\nwith n. To model sparsity in X, we allow M to tend to 0. To avoid degeneracy, we suppose\nthat there exists a sequence \u03c1 and a fixed matrix M 0 \u2208 RK\u00d7L such that \u03c1\u22121 M \u2192 M 0.\nDenote by M0 \u2208 R the convex hull of the entries of M 0. Let M be a neighborhood of M0.\n10\nTo adjust for the sparsity, we redefine the criterion and population criterion functions as\nF (g,h) =\n\u2211\nk,l\np\u02c6kq\u02c6lf(\u03c1\n\u22121X\u00afkl),\nG(C,D) =\n\u2211\nk,l\n[CT1]k[D\nT1]lf\n( [CTM 0D]kl\n[CT1]k [D\nT1]l\n)\n.\nWe discuss these modifications and the role of \u03c1 in Section ??.\nWe only consider nontrivial partitions; to this end, for \u03b5 > 0, define J\u03b5, the set of nontrivial\nlabellings as\nJ\u03b5 = {g,h : p\u02c6k(g) > \u03b5, q\u02c6l(h) > \u03b5}.\n4.1 Assumptions\nWe require the following regularity conditions:\n(C1) The biclusters are identifiable: no two rows of the M 0 are equal, and no two columns\nof M 0 are equal.\n(C2) The relative entropy function is locally strictly convex: f \u2032\u2032(\u00b5) > 0 when \u00b5 \u2208M.\n(C3) The third derivative of the relative entropy function is locally bounded: |f \u2032\u2032\u2032(\u00b5)| is\nbounded when \u00b5 \u2208M.\n(C4) The average variance of the elements is of the same order as \u03c1:\nlim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\n\u03c1mn\n\u2211\ni,j\nE[(Xij \u2212 \u00b5cidj)2] <\u221e.\n(C5) The mean matrix does not converge to zero too quickly:\nlim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n\u03c1\n\u221a\nnm =\u221e.\n11\n(C6) The elements satisfy a Lindeberg condition: for all \u03b5 > 0,\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\n\u03c12mn\n\u2211\ni,j\nE[(Xij \u2212 \u00b5cidj)2 I(|Xij \u2212 \u00b5cidj | > \u03b5\u03c1\n\u221a\nmn)] = 0.\nCondition (C1) is necessary for the biclusters to be identifiable, while (C2) and (C3) are mild\nregularity conditions on the entropy function.\nCondition (C4) is trivially satisfied for dense data and is satisfied for Binomial and Poisson\ndata so long as \u03c1\u22121M \u2192 M 0. However, this condition cannot handle arbitrary sparsity.\nFor example, if the elements of X are distributed as Negative Binomial random variables,\nthen condition (C4) requires that the product of the mean and the dispersion parameter\ndoes not tend to infinity. In other words, for sparse count data, the counts cannot be too\nheterogeneous.\nCondition (C5) places a sparsity restriction on the mean matrix. Zhao et al. (2012)\nused the same assumption to establish weak consistency for network clustering. A variant\nLyaponuv\u2019s condition (Varadhan, 2001) implies (C6). That is, if\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\n(\u03c1\n\u221a\nmn)2+\u03b4\n\u2211\ni,j\nE |Xij \u2212 \u00b5cidj |2+\u03b4 = 0\nfor some \u03b4 > 0, then (C6) follows. In particular, for dense data (\u03c1 bounded away from zero),\nuniformly bounded (2 + \u03b4) absolute central moments for any \u03b4 > 0 is sufficient. For many\ntypes of sparse data, including Bernoulli or Poisson data with \u03c1 converging to zero, (C5) is a\nsufficient condition for (C6).\nTheorem 4.1. Fix any \u03b5 > 0 with \u03b5 < mina{pa} and \u03b5 < minb{qb}. Let (g\u02c6, h\u02c6) satisfy\nF (g\u02c6, h\u02c6) = maxJ\u03b5 F (g,h). If conditions (C1)\u2013(C6) hold, then all limit points of C(g\u02c6) and\nD(h\u02c6) are permutations of diagonal matrices, i.e. the proportions of mislabeled rows and\ncolumns converge to zero in probability.\n12\nOur focus is on the cluster assignments, but, using the methods involved to prove Theo-\nrem 4.1, it is possible to show that when the assumptions of Theorem 4.1 are in force, then\nthe scaled estimate of the mean, \u03c1\u22121X\u00afkl converges in probability to the population quantity.\n(This follows from Theorem 4.1 and Lemma ?? from Supplement A.)\nUnder stronger distributional assumptions, we can use the methods of the proof to establish\nfinite-sample results. For example, if we assume that the elements of X are Gaussian, then\nthe following result holds.\nTheorem 4.2. Fix any \u03b5 > 0. Let (g\u02c6, h\u02c6) satisfy F (g\u02c6, h\u02c6) = maxJ\u03b5 F (g,h). If the elements of\nX are independent Gaussian random variables with constant variance \u03c32 and conditions (C1)\u2013\n(C3) hold, then for any 0 < \u03b4 < min\n{\n1, 8c\u03c3max{K\n2,L2}\n\u03c4\u03b52\n}\n,\nPr\n((\nC(g\u02c6),D(h\u02c6)\n)\n/\u2208 P\u03b4 \u2229Q\u03b4\n)\n\u2264 2Km+1Ln+1 exp\n{\n\u2212 Tn\u03c4\n2\u03b54\u03b42\n256c2\u03c32 max{K4, L4}\n}\n,\nwhere c = sup |f \u2032(\u00b5)| for \u00b5 in M,\nTn = inf\nk,l\n{\u2211\ni\n\u2211\nj\nI(gi = k, hj = l)|(g,h) \u2208 J\u03b5\n}\n.\nThe proof of this finite-sample result follows the same outline as the asymptotic result;\nAppendix ?? (Supplement A) gives details.\n5 Approximation algorithm\nProposition 3.3 shows that the maximizer of the profile log-likelihood F will give a good\nestimate of the true clusters. Unfortunately, finding this maximizer is computationally\nintractable. Maximizing F is a combinatorial optimization problem with an exponentially-\nlarge state space. To get around this, we will settle for finding a local optimum rather than a\nglobal one. We present an algorithm for finding a local optimum that, in practice, has good\nestimation performance.\n13\nOur approach is based on the Kernighan-Lin heuristic (Kernighan and Lin, 1970), which\nNewman (2006) used for a related problem, network community detection. After inputting\ninitial partitions for the rows and columns, we iteratively update the cluster assignments in a\ngreedy manner. The algorithm works as follows:\n1. Initialize the row and column labels g and h arbitrarily, and compute F .\n2. Repeat until convergence:\n(a) For each row i, determine which of the K possible label assignments for this row\nis optimal, keeping all other row and column labels fixed. Do not perform this\nassignment, but record the optimal label and the local improvement to F that\nwould result if this assignment were to be made.\n(b) For each column j, determine which of the L possible label assignments for this\ncolumn is optimal, keeping all other row and column labels fixed. As in step 2a, do\nnot perform this assignment, but record the optimal label and the local improvement\nto F that would result if this assignment were to be made.\n(c) In order of the local improvements recorded in steps 2a and 2b, sequentially perform\nthe individual cluster reassignments determined in these steps, and record the\nprofile likelihood after each reassignment. Note that these assignments are no\nlonger locally optimal since the labels of many of the rows and columns change\nduring this step. Thus, the profile likelihood could increase or decrease as we move\nsequentially through the assignments.\n(d) Out of the sequence of cluster assignments considered in step 2c, choose the one\nthat has the highest profile likelihood.\nSince the criterion function increases at each complete iteration, the algorithm will converge\nto a local optimum.\n14\nThere is no guarantee that the local optimum found by the algorithm will be the global\noptimum of the objective function F . To mitigate this deficiency, we will run the algorithm\nrepeatedly with many different random initializations for g and h. Each initialization can\ngive rise to a different local optimum. We choose the cluster assignment with the highest\nvalue of F among all local optima found by the procedure. As we increase the number of\nrandom initializations, the probability that the global optimum will be in this set will increase.\nWe found that 100\u2013250 initializations seem to suffice in the simulations and data examples.\nThe main computational bottleneck is updating the value of F (g,h) as we update the\nlabels g and h. We can do this efficiently by storing and incrementally updating the cluster\nproportions p\u02c6 and q\u02c6, the within-cluster row and column sums\nRil =\nn\u2211\nj=1\nXij I(hj = l) and Ckj =\nm\u2211\ni=1\nXij I(gi = k),\nand the block sums Bkl =\n\u2211m\ni=1Ril I(gi = k). Given the values of these quantities, we can\ncompute the criterion F (g,h) with O(KL) operations.\nIf we reassign the label of row i from k to k\u2032, then it is straightforward to update p\u02c6 with\nO(1) operations. The values of the within-cluster row sums Ril remain unchanged. The new\nvalues of the block sums are B\u2032kl = Bkl \u2212Ril and B\u2032k\u2032l = Bk\u2032l +Ril for l = 1, . . . , L; the other\nblock sums are unchanged. The expensive part of the update is recomputing the within-cluster\ncolumn sums Ckj for row labels k and k\n\u2032 and each column j. These computations require\nO(mn) operations if X is dense, and O(N) operations if X is sparse with at most N nonzero\nelements and N \u2265 max{m,n}.\nOverall we must perform O(N+KL) operations to reassign the label of row i. Reassigning\nthe label of column j has the same computational cost. Thus, one loop iteration in step 2\nrequires O((m + n)(N + KL)) operations. For dense data, one iteration requires O((m +\nn)(mn + KL)\n)\noperations. We do not have an upper bound on the number of iterations\nuntil the algorithm converges, but in our experiments we found that empirically, 25 to 30\n15\niterations suffice. These iteration counts may seem small, but in fact each iteration performs\nm row label assignments and n column label assignments. The convergence here is not a\nresult of early stopping\u2014we found that after 25\u201330 iterations, no possible local improvement\nwas possible.\nFor comparison, a spectral-based biclustering algorithm requires the top singular vectors of\nthe data matrix, which can be gotten in roughly O(mn) operations using Lanczos or another\nindirect method (Golub and Loan, 1996).\n6 Empirical evaluation\nHere we evaluate the performance of the profile likelihood based biclustering algorithm from\nSection 5. We simulate data from a variety of regimes, including sparse binary data and\ndense heavy-tailed continuous measurements. In these settings, we employ the following three\nrelative entropy functions:\nfBernoulli(\u00b5) = \u00b5 log \u00b5+ (1\u2212 \u00b5) log(1\u2212 \u00b5), (6.1a)\nfPoisson(\u00b5) = \u00b5 log \u00b5\u2212 \u00b5, (6.1b)\nfGaussian(\u00b5) = \u00b5\n2/2. (6.1c)\nWe evaluate performance both when the profile likelihood is correctly specified and when the\nrelative entropy function does not match the data distribution.\nIn our simulations, we report the proportion of misclassified rows and columns by the\nprofile likelihood based method (PL). We initialize partitions randomly, and then run the\nimprovement algorithm from Section 5 until convergence. We use multiple random starting\nvalues to minimize the possibility of finding a non-optimal stationary point.\nWe compare our method to two other biclustering algorithms. The first algorithm is a\nspectral biclustering algorithm, DI-SIM, motivated by a block model similar to ours (Rohe\nand Yu, 2012). The algorithm finds the singular value decomposition of the data matrix X,\n16\nand then applies k-means clustering to the top left and right singular vector loadings. The\nsecond algorithm we compare against, KM, ignores the interactions between the clusters, and\napplies k-means separately to the rows and columns of X.\nIn our first simulation, we generate sparse Poisson count data from a block model with\nK = 2 row clusters and L = 3 column clusters. We vary the number of columns, n, between\n200 to 1400 and we take the number of rows to be m = \u03b3n for \u03b3 \u2208 {0.5, 1, 2}. To assign the\ntrue row and column classes c and d, we sample independent multinomials with probabilities\np = (0.3, 0.7) and q = (0.2, 0.3, 0.5). We choose the matrix of block parameters to be\nM = [\u00b5ab] =\nb\u221a\nn\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ed0.92 0.77 1.66\n0.17 1.41 1.45\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f8 ,\nwhere b is chosen between 5 and 20; the entries of the matrix were chosen randomly, uniformly\non the interval [0, 2]. We chose the 1/\n\u221a\nn scaling so that the data matrix would be sparse,\nwith O(\u221an) elements in each row. We generate the data conditional on the row and column\nclasses as Xij | c,d \u223c Poisson(\u00b5cidj). We run all three methods with 250 random starting\nvalues.\nFigure 1 presents the average bicluster misclassification rates for each sample size and\nTable 1 reports the standard deviations. In all of the scenarios considered, biclustering based\non the profile likelihood criterion performs at least as well as the other methods, even when\nthe relative entropy function is misspecified (using PL-Gaus instead of PL-Pois). Moreover\nby looking at the standard deviations, we see that for the PL methods, the misclassification\nrate seems to be converging to zero as we increase n.\n17\nl\nl\nl l l l l\n200 400 600 800 1200\n0.\n0\n0.\n2\n0.\n4\nm = 0.5n, b = 5\nn\nAv\ng \nM\nisc\nla\nss\nific\nat\nio\nn \nRa\nte\nl l l l l l l\n200 400 600 800 1200\n0.\n0\n0.\n2\n0.\n4\nm = 0.5n, b = 10\nn\nAv\ng \nM\nisc\nla\nss\nific\nat\nio\nn \nRa\nte\nl l l l l l l\n200 400 600 800 1200\n0.\n0\n0.\n2\n0.\n4\nm = 0.5n, b = 20\nn\nAv\ng \nM\nisc\nla\nss\nific\nat\nio\nn \nRa\nte\nl\nl l l l l l\n200 400 600 800 1200\n0.\n00\n0.\n10\n0.\n20\nm = 1n, b = 5\nn\nAv\ng \nM\nisc\nla\nss\nific\nat\nio\nn \nRa\nte\nl l l l l l l\n200 400 600 800 1200\n0.\n00\n0.\n10\n0.\n20\nm = 1n, b = 10\nn\nAv\ng \nM\nisc\nla\nss\nific\nat\nio\nn \nRa\nte\nl l l l l l l\n200 400 600 800 1200\n0.\n00\n0.\n10\n0.\n20\nm = 1n, b = 20\nn\nAv\ng \nM\nisc\nla\nss\nific\nat\nio\nn \nRa\nte\nl\nl l l l l l\n200 400 600 800 1200\n0.\n00\n0.\n02\n0.\n04\nm = 2n, b = 5\nn\nAv\ng \nM\nisc\nla\nss\nific\nat\nio\nn \nRa\nte\nl l l l l l l\n200 400 600 800 1200\n0.\n00\n0.\n02\n0.\n04\nm = 2n, b = 10\nn\nAv\ng \nM\nisc\nla\nss\nific\nat\nio\nn \nRa\nte\nl l l l l l l\n200 400 600 800 1200\n0.\n00\n0.\n02\n0.\n04\nm = 2n, b = 20\nn\nAv\ng \nM\nisc\nla\nss\nific\nat\nio\nn \nRa\nte\nl PL KM DI\u2212SIM PL\u2212Gaus\nFigure 1: Average misclassification rates for Poisson example over 100 simulations.\nm = 0.5n\nPL-Pois PL-Norm KM DS\n200 0.0356 0.0147 0.0047 0.0878 0.0239 0.0070 0.0957 0.0438 0.0097 0.0403 0.0286 0.0114\n400 0.0182 0.0064 0.0013 0.0313 0.0091 0.0025 0.0478 0.0145 0.0033 0.0279 0.0144 0.0043\n600 0.0103 0.0034 0.0004 0.0153 0.0045 0.0011 0.0253 0.0068 0.0013 0.0186 0.0083 0.0026\n800 0.0076 0.0024 0.0003 0.0104 0.0039 0.0006 0.0188 0.0050 0.0009 0.0140 0.0069 0.0013\n1000 0.0054 0.0018 0.0003 0.0076 0.0029 0.0003 0.0122 0.0033 0.0004 0.0111 0.0040 0.0008\n1200 0.0041 0.0010 0.0001 0.0061 0.0017 0.0003 0.0092 0.0021 0.0003 0.0092 0.0034 0.0007\n1400 0.0036 0.0009 0.0001 0.0047 0.0014 0.0001 0.0077 0.0016 0.0001 0.0071 0.0023 0.0005\nm = n\nn b=5 b=10 b=20 b=5 b=10 b=20 b=5 b=10 b=20 b=5 b=10 b=20\n200 0.0160 0.0039 0.0009 0.0415 0.0069 0.0010 0.0663 0.0119 0.0019 0.0339 0.0128 0.0030\n400 0.0071 0.0017 0.0000 0.0101 0.0021 0.0004 0.0183 0.0034 0.0004 0.0152 0.0049 0.0009\n600 0.0036 0.0005 0.0000 0.0051 0.0008 0.0000 0.0100 0.0014 0.0000 0.0088 0.0024 0.0002\n800 0.0021 0.0003 0.0000 0.0035 0.0005 0.0000 0.0056 0.0009 0.0000 0.0064 0.0014 0.0001\n1000 0.0017 0.0002 0.0000 0.0026 0.0004 0.0000 0.0043 0.0006 0.0000 0.0050 0.0009 0.0000\n1200 0.0012 0.0001 0.0000 0.0020 0.0002 0.0000 0.0030 0.0004 0.0000 0.0036 0.0008 0.0000\n1400 0.0007 0.0001 0.0000 0.0012 0.0001 0.0000 0.0018 0.0002 0.0000 0.0025 0.0005 0.0000\nm = 2n\nn b=5 b=10 b=20 b=5 b=10 b=20 b=5 b=10 b=20 b=5 b=10 b=20\n200 0.0059 0.0010 0.0000 0.0118 0.0018 0.0000 0.0204 0.0027 0.0000 0.0141 0.0039 0.0000\n400 0.0022 0.0001 0.0000 0.0033 0.0003 0.0000 0.0071 0.0005 0.0000 0.0056 0.0010 0.0000\n600 0.0010 0.0000 0.0000 0.0014 0.0001 0.0000 0.0024 0.0002 0.0000 0.0025 0.0004 0.0000\n800 0.0004 0.0000 0.0000 0.0008 0.0000 0.0000 0.0015 0.0000 0.0000 0.0017 0.0001 0.0000\n1000 0.0002 0.0000 0.0000 0.0005 0.0000 0.0000 0.0009 0.0000 0.0000 0.0013 0.0000 0.0000\n1200 0.0002 0.0000 0.0000 0.0003 0.0001 0.0000 0.0006 0.0001 0.0000 0.0009 0.0001 0.0000\n1400 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0002 0.0000 0.0000 0.0005 0.0000 0.0000 0.0006 0.0000 0.0000\nTable 1: Standard deviations for Poisson example over 100 simulations\n18\nSupplement B describes in detail the simulations for Bernoulli, Gaussian, and heavy-tailed\nt data. These results are similar to the Poisson case. Our method performs at least as well as\nthe other procedures in all cases and shows signs of convergence.\nOverall, the simulations confirm the conclusions of Proposition 3.3, and they show that\nour approximate maximization algorithm performs well. These results give us confidence that\nprofile likelihood based biclustering can be used in practice.\n7 Applications\nIn this section we use profile-likelihood-based biclustering to reveal structure in two high-\ndimensional datasets. For each example, we maximize the profile log-likelihood using the\nalgorithm described in Section 5. An additional application example is provided in Supplement\nB.\n7.1 GovTrack\nIn our first application of the proposed method, we cluster legislators and motions based on\nthe roll-call votes from the 113th United States House of Representatives (years 2013\u20132014).\nWe validate our method by showing that the clusters found by the method agree with the\npolitical parties of the legislators.\nAfter downloading the roll-call votes from govtrack.org, we form a data matrix X with\nrows corresponding to the 444 legislators who voted in the House of Representatives, and\ncolumns corresponding to the 545 motions voted upon. Even though there are only 435 seats\nin the House of Representatives, 9 legislators were replaced mid-session when they resigned or\n19\ndied. We code the non-missing votes as\nXij =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1 if legislator i voted \u201cYea\u201d on motion j,\n0 if legislator i voted \u201cNay\u201d on motion j,\nNA if legislator i did not vote on motion j.\nNot all legislators vote on all motions, and 7% of the data matrix entries are missing, coded\nas NA. If we assume that the missing data mechanism is ignorable, then it is straightforward\nto extend our fitting procedure to handle incomplete data matrices. Specifically, to handle the\nmissing data, we replace sums over all matrix entries with sums over all non-missing matrix\nentries.\nTo choose the number of row clusters, K, and the number of column clusters, L, we fit\nall 100 candidate models with K and L each ranging between 1 and 10. Figure 2 plot show\nthe deviance (twice the negative log-likelihood) plotted as a function of K and L. The left\n\u201cscree\u201d plot shows that for most values of K, increasing L from 1 to 4 has a large effect of the\ndeviance, but increases L from 4 to a larger value has only a minor effect. Similarly, the right\nplot shows that increasing K from 1 to 2 causes a large drop in the deviance, but increasing\nK to a larger value has only a minor effect. Together, these plot suggest that we should pick\nK = 2 and L = 4.\nTo guard against the possibility of the bicluster algorithm finding a local rather than\nglobal optimum, we used 100 random initializations, and chose the row and column cluster\nassignments with the highest log-likelihood. To check the robustness of this assignment, we\nincreased the number of random initializations up to 1000. Even with 10 times as many\nrestarts, we still found the same optimal log-likelihood.\nFigure 3 shows a heatmap constructed after biclustering the data into 2 row clusters\nand 4 column clusters. The two row-clusters found by the algorithm completely recover the\npolitical parties of the legislators (every legislator in row cluster 1 is a Democrat, and every\n20\nll l l l l l l l l\nl\nl l l l l l l l l\n2 4 6 8 10\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\nK\nD\nev\nia\nnc\ne\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nL\n2 4 6 8 10\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\nFigure 2: GovTrack likelihood for different values of K and L\nlegislator in row cluster 2 is a Republican). The fact that we were able to recover the political\nparty provides us some confidence that the algorithm can find meaningful clusters in practice.\nThe column clusters reveal four types of motions: (1) motions with strong support from\nboth parties; (2) motions with moderate support from both parties; (3) motions with strong\nDemocratic support; (4) motions with strong Republican support.\nWe compared the clusters found by our method with those found by the two competing\nmethods, DI-SIM and KM. The competing methods do not directly handle missing data, so\nfor these methods we code \u201cYea\u201d as +1, \u201cNay\u201c as \u22121, and \u201cMissing\u201d as 0. DI-SIM returns the\nsame row-clusters, but classified 50 columns (9%) differently. KM placed 10 Republicans into\nthe majority-Democrat cluster; it classified 45 motions (8%) differently from profile likelihood.\nThe fact that all three methods are giving similar answers gives us confidence that the column\nclusters are meaningful.\n21\nFigure 3: Heatmap generated from GovTrack data reflecting the voting patterns in the in the\ndifferent biclusters. Blue (dark) identifies \u201cYea\u201d votes, yellow (light) identifies \u201cNay\u201d votes,\nand white identifies missing votes.\n7.2 AGEMAP\nBiclustering is commonly used for microarray data to visualize the activation patterns of\nthousands of genes simultaneously. It is used to identify patterns and discover distinguishing\nproperties between genes and individuals. We use the AGEMAP dataset (Zahn et al., 2007)\nto illustrate this process.\nAGEMAP is a large microarray data set containing the log expression levels for 40 mice\nacross 8,932 genes measured on 16 different tissue types. For this analysis, we restrict attention\nto two tissue types: cerebellum and cerebrum. The 40 mice in the dataset belong to four age\ngroups, with five males and five females in each group. One of the mice is missing data for\nthe cerebrum tissue so it has been removed from the dataset.\nOur goal is to uncover structure in the gene expression matrix. We bicluster the 39\n\u00d7 17,864 residual matrix computed from the least squares solution to the multiple linear\nregression model\nYij = \u03b20j + \u03b21jAi + \u03b22jSi + \u03b5ij,\nwhere Yij is the log-activation of gene j in mouse i, Ai is the age of mouse i, Si indicates if\n22\nmouse i is male, \u03b5ij is a random error, and (\u03b20j, \u03b21j, \u03b22j) is a gene-specific coefficient vector.\nHere, we are biclustering the residual matrix rather than the raw gene expression matrix\nbecause we are interested in the structure remaining after adjusting for the observed covariates.\nThe entries of the residual matrix are not independent (for example, the sum of each\ncolumn is zero). Also, the responses of many genes are likely correlated with each other. Thus,\nthe block model required by Theorem 4.1 is not in force, so its conclusion will not hold unless\nthe dependence between the residuals is negligible. In light of this caveat, the example should\nbe considered as exploratory data analysis.\nWe perform biclustering using profile likelihood based on the Gaussian criterion (6.1c)\nwith 100 random initializations. To determine an appropriate number of mice clusters, K,\nand gene clusters, L, we experiment with values of K and L between 1 and 15. Figure 4\npresents the scree plots. The left plot shows that increasing L beyond 5 has a relatively small\nimpact on the deviance, and similarly, the right plot shows that increasing K beyond 3 has a\nrelatively minor effect. This suggests we should set K = 3 and L = 5. For this choice of K\nand L, we experimented with using up to 1000 random starting values, but found no change\nto the resulting log-likelihood.\nl l l l l l l l l l l l l l l\nl\nl l l l l l l l l l l l l\nl\nl l l l l l l l l l l l l\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n\u22120.030\n\u22120.025\n\u22120.020\n\u22120.015\n\u22120.010\n\u22120.005\n0.000\nK\nD\nev\nia\nnc\ne\nl l\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nll\nL\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n\u22120.030\n\u22120.025\n\u22120.020\n\u22120.015\n\u22120.010\n\u22120.005\n0.000\nFigure 4: AgeMap likelihood for different values of K and L\n23\nFigure 5: Heatmap generated from AGEMAP residual data reflecting the varying expression\npatterns in the different biclusters. The colors for the matrix entries correspond encode to\nthe first quartile, the middle two quartiles, and the upper quartile.\nThe heatmap presented in Figure 7.2 shows the results. The expression levels for gene\ngroup 1 and 3 appear to be fairly neutral across the three mouse groups, but the other\nthree gene groups have a more visually apparent pattern. It appears that a mouse can have\nexpression levels for at most two of gene groups 2, 4, and 5. Mouse group 2 has high expression\nfor gene groups 2 and 4; mouse group 2 has high expression for gene group 4; and mouse\ngroup 3 has high expression for gene group 5.\nWe computed the bicluster assignments found by DI-SIM and KM. The methods failed to\nconverge after 1000 iterations, but the resulting cluster assignments found by KM and the\nprofile likelihood method generally agreed, with 89.6% cluster agreement. DI-SIM agreed less\nwith the other two methods. Between DI-SIM and the profile likelihood method the cluster\nagreement was 62.5%, and the cluster agreement between DI-SIM and KM was 67.8%.\nThe three clusters of mice found by the profile-likelihood method also agree with those\nfound by Perry and Owen (2010). That analysis identified the mouse clusters, but could not\nattribute meaning to them. The bicluster based analysis has deepened our understanding of\n24\nthe three mouse clusters while suggesting some interesting interactions between the genes.\n8 Discussion\nWe have developed a statistical setting for studying the performance of biclustering algorithms.\nUnder the assumption that the data follows a stochastic block model, we derived sufficient\nconditions for an algorithm based on maximizing a profile-likelihood based criterion function\nto be consistent. This is the first theoretical guarantee for any biclustering algorithm which\ncan be applied to a broad range of data distributions and can handle both sparse and dense\ndata matrices.\nSince maximizing the criterion function exactly is computationally infeasible, we have\nproposed an approximate algorithm for obtaining a local optimum rather than a global one.\nWe have shown through simulations that the approximation algorithm has good performance\nin practice. Our empirical comparisons demonstrated that the method performs well in a\nvariety of situations and can outperform existing procedures.\nApplying the profile-likelihood based biclustering algorithm to real data revealed several\ninteresting findings. Our results from the GovTrack dataset demonstrated our methods ability\nto recover ground truth labels when available, and identified motion clusters that were robust\nacross different methods. Biclustering the genes and mice in the AGEMAP data exposed an\ninteresting pattern in the expression of certain genes and we found that at most two gene\ngroups can have high expression levels for any one mouse. The consistency theorem proved in\nthis report gives conditions under which we can have confidence in the robustness of these\nfindings.\n25\nSupplementary Materials\nSupplement A Additional Proofs and Theoretical Results\n(supp-theory.pdf).

Perry\nNew York University\nNovember 17, 2015\nA Proof of Formal Consistency Theorem\nOur proof of the main theoretical results follows the same outline as Section 3.\nIn particular, Proposition A.2 is a rigorous statement analogous to Proposi-\ntion 3.1; Proposition A.3 is analogous to Proposition 3.2; Theorems 4.1 and 4.2\nare analogous to Proposition 3.3.\nA.1 Population criterion\nHere, we give a rigorous statement of Proposition 3.1. That is, we establish\nthat in the limit, F is close to its nonrandom population version, G, which\ndepends only on the confusion matrices.\n1\nWe will need some additional notation and a concentration result. Define\nnormalized residual matrix R(g,h) \u2208 RK\u00d7L by\nR(g,h) = \u03c1\u22121{X\u00af(g,h)\u2212E(g,h)}.\nThe law of large numbers establishes that for fixed g and h, the convergence\nRkl(g,h)\nP\u2192 0 holds. We can prove a stronger concentration result, that this\nconvergence is uniform over all g and h.\nLemma A.1. Under conditions (C1)\u2013(C6), for all \u03b5 > 0,\nsup\nJ\u03b5\n\u2016R(g,h)\u2016\u221e P\u2192 0,\nwhere \u2016A\u2016\u221e = maxk,l |Akl| for any matrix A.\nProof. For all t > 0,\nPr\n(\nsup\nJ\u03b5\n\u2016R(g,h)\u2016\u221e > t\n)\n\u2264 KLPr\n(\nsup\nI\u2208In\n\u03c1\u22121\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2211\n{i,j}\u2208I\n(Xij \u2212 \u00b5cidj)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 > t|I|),\nwhere In \u2282 2[n]\u00d7 2[m] is the set of all biclusters such that p\u02c6k > \u03b5 for all k and\nq\u02c6l > \u03b5 for all l. Since In is a subset of the power set 2[nm], by Lemma B.1 in\nAppendix B, it follows that the right hand side tends to zero.\nWith Lemma A.1, we can establish that in the limit, F (g,h) is close to\nG(C,D).\n2\nProposition A.2. F is close to its population version in the sense that, for\nall \u03b5 > 0,\nsup\nJ\u03b5\n|F (g,h)\u2212G(C,D)| P\u2192 0.\nProof. The technical assumptions of f imply that its first derivative is\nbounded. Therefore, f is locally Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant\nc = sup |f \u2032(\u00b5)| for \u00b5 in a neighborhood of M and\n|F (g,h)\u2212G(C,D)| \u2264 c\u2016R(g,h)\u2016\u221e.\nFrom Proposition A.1, the right hand side converges to zero almost surely\nand the result follows.\nA.2 Self-consistency\nOnce we have established that F is close to its population version, our next\ntask is to show that the population version is self-consistent. We will need a\nmore precise version of Proposition 3.2.\nTo state the result, for \u03b4 > 0, define\nP\u03b4 = {C \u2208 Cp : max\na6=a\u2032\nCakCa\u2032k < \u03b4}, (A.1a)\nQ\u03b4 = {D \u2208 Cq : max\nb 6=b\u2032\nDblDb\u2032l < \u03b4}. (A.1b)\nA permutation of a diagonal matrix has only one non-zero entry in each\ncolumn, so taking \u03b4 close to zero restricts the confusion matrices to be close\n3\nto permutations of diagonal matrices.\nProposition A.3. If mina{pa} > \u03b7, minb{qb} > \u03b7, and (C,D) /\u2208 P\u03b4 \u00d7Q\u03b4,\nthen G(C,D) is small, in the sense that\nG(C,D)\u2212\n\u2211\na,b\npa qb f(\u03c1\n\u22121\u00b5ab) \u2264 \u2212\u03ba\u03b72\u03b4,\nwhere \u03ba is a constant independent of \u03b4 and \u03b7.\nProof. If D /\u2208 Q\u03b4, then for some l and some b 6= b\u2032, DblDb\u2032l \u2265 \u03b4. Since no\ntwo columns of M are identical, there exists an a such that \u00b5ab 6= \u00b5ab\u2032 . Let k\nbe the index of the largest element in row a of matrix C; this element must\nbe at least as large as the mean, i.e.\nCak \u2265 [C1]a\nK\n\u2265 \u03b7\nK\n.\nLet W = [CT1]k[D\nT1]l; this is nonzero. Now, there exists \u00b5\u2217 \u2208M such that\n[CTMD]kl = CakDbl\u00b5ab + CakDb\u2032l\u00b5ab\u2032 + (W \u2212 CakDbl \u2212 CakDb\u2032l)\u00b5\u2217.\nLet z = [CTMD]kl/W . Set \u03ba0 = inf\u00b5\u2208M f \u2032\u2032(\u00b5) and define N = [\u03bdab] \u2208 RA\u00d7B\nwith \u03bdab = f(\u03c1\n\u22121\u00b5ab). By a refined Jensen\u2019s inequality (Lemma B.2 in\n4\nAppendix B), it follows that\n[CTND]kl\nW\n\u2212 f(z) \u2265 \u03ba0C\n2\nakDblDb\u2032l\nW 2\n(1\n2\n(\u00b5ab \u2212 z)2 + 1\n2\n(z \u2212 \u00b5ab\u2032)2\n)\n\u2265 \u03ba0C\n2\nakDblDb\u2032l\nW 2\n(1\n2\n(\u00b5ab \u2212 z) + 1\n2\n(z \u2212 \u00b5ab\u2032)\n)2\n= \u03ba0\nC2akDblDb\u2032l\n4W 2\n(\u00b5ab \u2212 \u00b5ab\u2032)2.\nThus\n[CT1]k[D\nT1]lf\n(\n[CTM 0D]kl\n[CT1]k[D\nT1]l\n)\n\u2212 [CTND]kl\n\u2264 \u2212\u03ba0\n2\n(\u00b5ab \u2212 \u00b5ab\u2032)2C\n2\nakDblDb\u2032l\nW\n\u2264 \u2212\u03ba0\u03b7\n2\u03b4\n4K2\n(\u00b5ab \u2212 \u00b5ab\u2032)2.\nThis inequality only holds for one particular choice of k and l; for other\nchoices, the left hand side is nonpositive by Jensen\u2019s inequality. Defining\n\u03ba1 =\n\u03ba0\n4\nmin\na,b 6=b\u2032\n(\u00b5ab \u2212 \u00b5ab\u2032)2,\nit follows that\nG(C,D)\u2212\n\u2211\na,b\npa qb f(\u03c1\n\u22121\u00b5ab) \u2264 \u2212\u03ba1 \u03b7\n2\u03b4\nK2\n.\nSimilarly, if C /\u2208 P\u03b4, then the right hand side is bounded by\n\u2212\u03ba2 \u03b72\u03b4/L2\n5\nwhere\n\u03ba2 =\n\u03ba0\n4\nmin\na6=a\u2032,b\n(\u00b5ab \u2212 \u00b5a\u2032b)2.\nThe result of the proposition follows with \u03ba = min(\u03ba1, \u03ba2)/max{K2, L2}.\nA.3 Consistency\nWe are now ready to state and prove the formal consistency theorem.\nProof of Theorem 4.1. Fix \u03b4 > 0 and define P\u03b4 and Q\u03b4 as in (A.1). We will\nshow that if (g,h) \u2208 J\u03b5 and if (C(g),D(h)) /\u2208 (P\u03b4,Q\u03b4), then F (g,h) <\nF (c,d) with probability approaching one. Moreover, this inequality holds\nuniformly over all such choices of (g,h). Since \u03b4 is arbitrary, this implies\nthat C(g\u02c6) and D(h\u02c6) converge to permutations of diagonal matrices, i.e. the\nproportions of misclassified rows and columns converge to zero.\nSet rn = supJ\u03b5 |F (g,h) \u2212 G(C(g),D(h)|. Suppose (g,h) \u2208 J\u03b5. In this\ncase,\nF (g,h)\u2212 F (c,d) \u2264 2rn + {G(C(g),D(h))\u2212G(C(c),D(d))}\n= 2rn +\n{\nG(C(g),D(h))\u2212\n\u2211\na,b\n[C1]a[D1]bf([M 0]ab)\n}\n.\nPick \u03b7 > 0 smaller than mina{pa} and minb{qb}. By assumption, the true\nrow and column class proportions converge to p and q. Thus, for all g \u2208 Km\nand h \u2208 Ln, for n large enough, [C(g)]a \u2265 \u03b7 and [D(h)]b \u2265 \u03b7; this holds\nuniformly over all choices of (g,h).\n6\nApplying Proposition A.3, to the second term in the inequality, we get\nthat with probability approaching one,\nF (g,h)\u2212 F (c,d) \u2264 2rn \u2212 \u03ba\u03b72\u03b4\nfor all (g,h) \u2208 J\u03b5 such that (C(g),D(h)) /\u2208 P\u03b4 \u00d7Q\u03b4. By Proposition A.2,\nrn\nP\u2192 0. Thus, with probability approaching one, (C(g\u02c6),D(h\u02c6)) \u2208 P\u03b4 \u00d7Q\u03b4.\nSince this result holds for all \u03b4, all limit points of C(g\u02c6) and D(h\u02c6) must be\npermutations of diagonal matrices.\nA.4 Empirical treatment of \u03c1\nFor the Poisson and Gaussian relative entropy functions (6.1b) and (6.1c),\nthe maximizer of the criterion function (2.2) does not depend on the scale\nfactor \u03c1. This is immediately obvious in the Gaussian case. For the Poisson\ncase, the function fPoisson(\u00b5/\u03c1) =\n1\n\u03c1\n\u00b5 log(\u00b5)\u2212 1\n\u03c1\n\u00b5(1 + log(\u03c1)). When summed\nover all biclusters, the second term in this sum is equal to a constant so the\nvalue of \u00b5 which maximizes fPoisson(\u00b5/\u03c1) does not depend on the value of \u03c1.\nThis is not the case for the Binomial relative entropy function (6.1a), but\nthe parameter \u03c1 is not identifiable in practice so it does not make sense to\ntry to estimate it. For our simulations we use which maximizes \u03c1 = 1 in\nthe fitting procedure, regardless of the true scale factor for the mean matrix\nM . Even though in the simulations the identifiability condition doesn\u2019t hold\nfor this choice of \u03c1, we still get consistency, because the maximizer of the\n7\ncriterion with fBernoulli(\u00b5) is close to the maximizer with fPoisson(\u00b5). See Perry\nand Wolfe (2012) for discussion of a related phenomenon.\nB Additional Technical Results\nLemma B.1. For each n, let Xn,m, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 n, be independent random\nvariables with EXn,m = 0. Let \u03c1n be a sequence of positive numbers.

Let \u03b5 > 0 be arbitrary.

To proceed in this setting, we make stronger distributional\nassumptions than in the asymptotic case. Specifically, we assume here that\nthe entries Xij|c,d follow a Gaussian distribution with mean \u00b5cidj and finite\nvariance \u03c32. We proceed with the notation from the main text.\n11\nProposition C.1.

If the entries Xij follow a Gaussian distribution with mean \u00b5cidj and\nvariance \u03c32 then\nE\n(\n|Xij \u2212 \u00b5cidj |l\n)\n\u2264 \u03c3\n2\n2\n\u03c3l\u22122l!\nso the conditions of Bernstein\u2019s inequality hold.

The details are similar to proof\nof Proposition A.2.\nThe next step is to show that population version is maximized at the true\nclass labels.\nProposition C.3. Choose \u03c4 > 0 such that mina6=a\u2032,b(\u00b5ab \u2212 \u00b5a\u2032b)2 \u2265 \u03c4 and\nmina,b 6=b\u2032(\u00b5ab \u2212 \u00b5ab\u2032)2 \u2265 \u03c4 . Then for all \u03b5 > 0, for (g,h) \u2208 J\u03b5 and (C,D) /\u2208\nP\u03b4 \u2229Q\u03b4, G(C,D) is small in the sense that\nG(C,D)\u2212\n\u2211\na,b\npaqbf(\u03c1\n\u22121\u00b5ab) \u2264 \u2212 \u03c4\u03b5\n2\u03b4\n4 max{K2, L2} .\nThe proof of Proposition C.3 is similar to the proof of Proposition A.3\nexcept that the bound on the difference uses \u03b5 in place of the value \u03b7. Some\ndetails follow.\nProof of Proposition C.3. First note that in Proposition A.3, we can let a be\nthe index of the largest element in column k of matrix C; then, since we are\n13\nrestricted to the set J\u03b5, this element must be at least as large as\nCak \u2265 [C\nT1]k\nK\n\u2265 \u03b5\nK\n.\nNoting that for the Gaussian relative entropy function f \u2032\u2032(\u00b5) = 1 for all \u00b5 \u2208M,\nthe remainder of the proof is similar to the proof of Proposition A.3.\nWe establish a finite sample bound by combining these results.\nProof. Proof of Theorem 4.2 Fix \u03b4 > 0 and define P\u03b4 and Q\u03b4 as in Proposi-\ntion A.3. Set rn = supJ\u03b5 |F (g,h)\u2212G(C(g),D(h)|. Suppose (g,h) \u2208 J\u03b5. In\nthis case,\nF (g,h)\u2212 F (c,d) \u2264 2rn + {G(C(g),D(h))\u2212G(C(c),D(d))}\n= 2rn +\n{\nG(C(g),D(h))\u2212\n\u2211\na,b\n[C1]a[D1]bf([M 0]ab)\n}\n.\nApplying Proposition C.3 to the second term in the inequality, we get that\nF (g,h)\u2212 F (c,d) \u2264 2rn \u2212 \u03c4\u03b5\n2\u03b4\n4 max{K2, L2}\nfor all (g,h) \u2208 J\u03b5 such that (C,D) /\u2208 P\u03b4\u2229Q\u03b4. The result follows by applying\nProposition C.2.\n14\nConsistent Biclustering: Additional Empirical\nResults\nCheryl J. Flynn and Patrick O.

These results provide further\nverification of the theoretical findings and support the use of biclustering\nbased on the profile log-likelihood criterion.\n2 Additional Application - MovieLens\nSince consumer habits likely vary depending on products, biclustering review-\nwebsite data can help identify structure in the data and identify groups of\nconsumers and groups of products with similar patterns. As an application\nof this we apply biclustering to the MovieLens dataset (?).\nThe MovieLens dataset consists of 100,000 movie reviews on 1682 movies\nby 943 users. Each user has rated at least 20 movies and each movie is rated\non a scale from one to five. In addition to the review rating, the release date\n6\nand genre of each movie is available as well as some demographic information\nabout each user including gender, age, occupation and zip code.\nIn order to retain customers, movie-renting services strive to recommend\nnew movies to individuals who are likely to view them. Since most users only\nreview movies that they have already seen, we can use the structure of the\nuser-movie review matrix to identify associations between users and viewing\nhabits of movies. Specifically, we consider the 943\u00d71682 binary matrix X\nwhere Xij = 1 if user i has rated movie j and Xij = 0 otherwise. To find\nstructure in X, we biclustered the rows and columns of X using the profile\nlikelihood based on the Bernoulli criterion (6.1a).\nTo determine a reasonable selection for the number of biclusters we varied\nthe number of user groups, K, and the number of movie groups, L, each from\n1 to 10. For each combination of K and L, we computed the optimal cluster\nassignments based on 250 random starting values. Figure 4 presents the scree\nplots as functions of K and L. From the left scree plot, we see little change\nto the deviance when increasing L beyond 4. From the right scree plot, the\ndeviance does not decrease much beyond when increasing K beyond 3. Based\non these two plots, we set K = 3 and L = 4. For K = 3 and L = 4, we\nexperimented with using up to 2000 random starting values, but found no\nchange to the resulting log-likelihood.\n7\nll\nl l l l l l l l\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl l l l l l\n2 4 6 8 10\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\nK\nD\nev\nia\nnc\ne\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nL\n2 4 6 8 10\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\nFigure 4: MovieLens likelihood for different values of K and L\nFigure 5: Heatmap generated from MovieLens data reflecting the varying\nreview patterns in the different biclusters. Blue identifies movies with no\nreview and white identifies rated movies.\n8\nWe compared the resulting bicluster assignments to those found by Di-Sim\nand K-Means. The cluster assignments varied between the three methods, with\nthe least amount of disagreement between K-Means and the profile-likelihood\nmethod (55.2% of cluster assignments agreed) and the most disagreement\nbetween Di-Sim and the profile-likelihood method (24.2% of clusters agreed).\nFigure 5 presents the heatmap of the data based on the resulting bicluster\nassignments from the profile-likelihood method, with the ordering of the\nclusters determined by the total number of a reviews in each cluster. Roughly\nspeaking, user group 3 is consistently active across all movie groups with\nincreasing activity as the popularity of the movie increases. The reviewing\nhabits of user group 2 follow a similar pattern but to a lesser extent. In\ncontrast, user group 1 is consistently inactive with the only exceptions being\nmovie group 4.\nThe median ages within the user group were 33, 30, and 29, and the\npercentages of male users within each group were 68.7%, 72.8%, and 77.4%.\nThese statistics suggest that there is some age and gender effect on the\nreviewing habits of the users.\nTable 4 reports the top ten movies in each group. The eclectic mix of\ngenres within each movie group suggests that the rating behavior of users is\nnot explained by genre alone.\nFigure 2 presents a boxplot comparing the distributions of the movie\nrelease years for each group. We can see a clear ordering of the movie groups\nby median release date. It appears that the users in all three groups rate\n9\nmovies from all time periods, but reviewing behavior varies based on movie\npopularity. The biclusters here suggest that individuals in group 3 are more\nlikely to rate under-reviewed movies, whereas individuals in group 1 primarily\nrate popular movies.\nGroup 1 Group 2\nMrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994) Santa Clause, The (1994)\nMiserables, Les (1995) Sleeper (1973)\nLawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace (1996) Sword in the Stone, The (1963)\nRichie Rich (1994) Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The (1989)\nCandyman: Farewell to the Flesh (1995) Somewhere in Time (1980)\nIce Storm, The (1997) Mulholland Falls (1996)\nFunny Face (1957) Crumb (1994)\nUmbrellas of Cherbourg, The (1964) I.Q.

The metric family g\u00aft is found\nfrom field equations, whereas the metric family gt is used to propagate sources and\nto compare predictions to experiments. A linear and symmetric affine connection\n\u2207\n\u22c6\ncompatible with the family gt is defined, giving rise to equations of motion.\nFurthermore a quasi-metric theory of gravity, including field equations and local\nconservation laws, is presented.

The dynamical nature of this foliation makes the field equa-\ntions unsuitable for a standard PPN-analysis. This implies that the experimental\nstatus of the theory is not completely clear at this point in time. The theory seems\nto be consistent with a number of cosmological observations and it satisfies all the\nclassical solar system tests, though. Moreover, in its non-metric sector the new\ntheory has experimental support where General Relativity fails or is irrelevant.\n1 Introduction\nInterest in alternative classical theories of gravity has mainly focused on the class of\nmetric theories, defined by the postulates [1]\n\u2022 Space-time is equipped with a single Lorentzian metric field g,\n\u2022 The world lines of inertial test particles are geodesics of g,\n\u2022 In the local Lorentz frames, the non-gravitational physics is as in Special Relativity.\n1\nOne reason for the neglect of non-metric theories is probably the successes of the leading\nmetric theory, General Relativity (GR): constructing alternative theories not deviating\ntoo significantly in structure from GR seems compelling if one is not prepared to risk\nimmediate conflict with observation.\nBut another reason is possibly the belief that theories which do not satisfy the above\npostulates necessarily fail to satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) defined by\nthe restrictions [1]\n\u2022 The trajectories of uncharged test particles do not depend on their internal com-\nposition (this is the Weak Equivalence Principle),\n\u2022 The outcomes of local non-gravitational test experiments do not depend on the\nvelocity of the apparatus (this is called local Lorentz invariance),\n\u2022 The outcomes of local non-gravitational test experiments do not depend on when\nor where they are performed (this is called local position invariance).\nSince the empirical evidence supporting the EEP seems formidable [1], constructing a\ntheory violating it probably would be a waste of time. But is it really true that theories\nnot satisfying all the said postulates necessarily violate the EEP?\nNo, it is not. It can be shown that it is possible to construct a type of relativistic\nspace-time framework not satisfying the first two postulates but where the EEP still holds\n[2]. This framework defines the geometrical basis for Quasi-Metric Relativity (QMR), just\nas pseudo-Riemannian geometry defines the geometrical basis for metric relativity.\nA general physical motivation for introducing the quasi-metric framework is found\ndirectly in the particular global structure of quasi-metric space-time. That is, the ge-\nometric structure behind QMR is constructed to yield maximal predictive power with\nregard to the large-scale properties of space-time. The basic idea that makes this pos-\nsible is that since the Universe is unique, so should the nature of its global evolution\nbe. That is, there should be no reason to treat the Universe as a purely gravitational\ndynamical system and its global evolution should not depend on any particular choice\nof initial conditions. This means that the global evolution of the Universe should be\nexplicitly included into the geometric structure of quasi-metric space-time as some sort\nof prior-geometric property. It is natural to call the global evolution of the Universe\n\u201cnon-kinematical\u201d since by construction, this evolution is not part of space-time\u2019s causal\nstructure and is unaffected by dynamics. In other words, in QMR the global evolution of\nthe Universe is described as a non-kinematical cosmic expansion. One important conse-\nquence of this is that a global arrow of time exists as an intrinsic, geometrical property\n2\nof quasi-metric space-time. The quasi-metric framework thus represents an attractive\nsolution of the problem of time-asymmetry. (See e.g. [3] and references therein for more\non this problem.)\nThe quasi-metric framework and some of its predictions will be described in some\ndetail in the following. Note that since this paper is intended to be a not too lengthy\nintroduction to QMR, derivations of formulae are in general omitted. However, more\ndetailed derivations can often be found in [2].\n2 The quasi-metric space-time framework\n2.1 Basic mathematical structure\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the basic premise of the quasi-metric framework is\nthat the cosmic expansion should be described as a non-kinematical phenomenon. To\nfulfil this premise it is necessary that the canonical description of space-time is taken\nas fundamental. Furthermore, to ensure that the cosmic expansion really is global and\ndirectly integrated into the geometric structure of quasi-metric space-time, it is necessary\nto introduce the global time function t representing an extra, degenerate time dimension\n(see below). This extra time dimension must be degenerate since it is designed to describe\nthe cosmic expansion as independent of space-time\u2019s causal structure and taking the form\nof a non-kinematical global scale change between gravitational and non-gravitational\nsystems. We will elaborate on this in the following where we define the quasi-metric\nframework precisely in terms of geometrical structures on a differentiable manifold.\nMathematically, the quasi-metric framework can be described by first considering a\n5-dimensional product manifold M\u00d7R1, where M = S\u00d7R2 is a (globally hyperbolic)\nLorentzian space-time manifold, R1 and R2 are two copies of the real line and S is\na compact Riemannian 3-dimensional manifold (without boundaries). It is natural to\ninterpret t as a coordinate on R1. Besides, the product topology ofM implies that once\nt is given, there must exist a \u201cpreferred\u201d ordinary time coordinate x0 on R2 such that\nx0 scales like ct. It is very convenient to choose a time coordinate x0 which scales like ct\nsince this means that x0 is in some sense a mirror of t and that they thus are \u201cequivalent\u201d\nglobal time coordinates but designed to parametrize fundamentally different phenomena.\nA coordinate system with a global time coordinate of this type we call a global time\ncoordinate system (GTCS). Hence, expressed in a GTCS {x\u00b5} (where \u00b5 can take any\nvalue 0 \u2212 3), x0 is interpreted as a global time coordinate on R2 and {xj} (where j can\ntake any value 1\u22123) as spatial coordinates on S. The class of GTCSs is a set of preferred\n3\ncoordinate systems inasmuch as the equations of QMR take special forms in a GTCS.\nWe now equip M\u00d7R1 with two degenerate 5-dimensional metrics g\u00aft and gt. By defi-\nnition, the metric g\u00aft represents a solution of field equations, and from g\u00aft one can construct\nthe \u201cphysical\u201d metric gt which is used when comparing predictions to experiments. To\nreduce the 5-dimensional space-time M\u00d7R1 to a 4-dimensional space-time, we just slice\nthe 4-dimensional sub-manifold N determined by the equation x0 = ct (using a GTCS)\nout of M\u00d7R1. Moreover, in N , g\u00aft and gt are interpreted as one-parameter metric fam-\nilies (this is merely a matter of semantics). Thus by construction, N is a 4-dimensional\nspace-time manifold equipped with two one-parameter families of Lorentzian 4-metrics\nparametrized by the global time function t. This is the general form of the quasi-metric\nspace-time framework. We will call N a quasi-metric space-time manifold. And the\nreason why N is different from a Lorentzian space-time manifold is that the affine con-\nnection compatible with any metric family is non-metric. This means that, while it is\nalways possible to equip N with the single metric obtained by inserting the explicit sub-\nstitution t = x0/c into gt, this metric is useless for other purposes than taking scalar\nproducts. That is, since the affine structure on N is inherited from the affine structure\non M\u00d7R1, and since that affine structure is not compatible with any single metric on\nN (see below), one must separate between ct and x0 in gt.\nFrom the definition of quasi-metric space-time we see that it is constructed as consist-\ning of two mutually orthogonal foliations: on the one hand space-time can be sliced up\nglobally into a family of 3-dimensional space-like hypersurfaces (called the fundamental\nhypersurfaces (FHSs)) by the global time function t, on the other hand space-time can\nbe foliated into a family of time-like curves everywhere orthogonal to the FHSs. These\ncurves represent the world lines of a family of hypothetical observers called the funda-\nmental observers (FOs), and the FHSs together with t represent a preferred notion of\nspace and time. That is, the equations of any theory of gravity based on quasi-metric\ngeometry should depend on quantities obtained from this preferred way of splitting up\nspace-time into space and time. But notice that the extra structure of quasi-metric space-\ntime (as compared to Lorentzian space-time) has no effects on local non-gravitational test\nexperiments.\nNext we describe the affine structure on (N , gt). (Note that we introduce the coor-\ndinate notation g(t)\u00b5\u03bd where the parenthesis is put in to emphasize that these are the\ncomponents of a one-parameter family of metrics rather than those of a single metric.)\nAgain we start with the corresponding structure onM\u00d7R1. To find that we should think\nof the metric family gt as one single degenerate metric onM\u00d7R1, where the degeneracy\nmanifests itself via the condition gt(\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n, \u00b7)\u22610. The natural way to proceed is to determine\n4\na torsion-free, metric-compatible 5-dimensional \u201cdegenerate\u201d connection\n\u22c6\n\u2207 on M\u00d7R1\nfrom the metric-preserving condition\n\u2202\n\u2202t\ngt(yt, zt) = gt(\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\nyt, zt) + gt(yt,\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\nzt), (1)\ninvolving arbitrary families of vector fields yt and zt inM. It turns out that it is possible\nto find a unique candidate connection satisfying equation (1) in general and differing from\nthe usual Levi-Civita connection only via connection coefficients containing t. This can-\ndidate connection is determined from the in general non-zero connection coefficients \u0393\n\u22c6\n\u03b1\n\u00b5t\nwhich must be equal to 1\n2\ng\u03b1\u03c3(t)\n\u2202\n\u2202t\ng(t)\u03c3\u00b5 (we use Einstein\u2019s summation convention through-\nout), since other connection coefficients containing t must vanish identically.\nBut the above-mentioned candidate degenerate connection has one undesirable prop-\nerty, namely that it does not in general ensure that the unit normal vector field family\nnt of the FHSs (with the property gt(nt,nt) = \u22121) is parallel-transported along\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n. It\nwould be natural to require this property, i.e.,\n\u22c6\n\u2207 should guarantee that\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\nnt = 0, (2)\nsince if equation (2) does not hold the resulting equations of motion will not be identical\nto the geodesic equation derived from\n\u22c6\n\u2207. However, we may try to construct a unique\ndegenerate connection which satisfies equation (2) and is identical to the above-mentioned\ncandidate connection for those particular cases when the candidate connection satisfies\nequation (2). This is possible since the dependence of gt on t cannot be arbitrary. That\nis, the (global) explicit dependence of gt and g\u00aft on t is the same and it can be inferred\nindependently. Moreover, it takes a particular form (see equation (13) below), making\nit possible to construct a unique degenerate connection which satisfies both equations\n(1) and (2) (given the particular dependence of gt on t). This unique connection is\ndetermined from the form the connection coefficients take in a GTCS, and it involves the\ncomponents h(t)ij of the family ht of spatial metrics intrinsic to the FHSs. Said (nonzero)\nconnection coefficients read\n\u0393\n\u22c6\ni\njt =\n1\n2\nhis(t)\n\u2202\n\u2202t\nh(t)sj , \u0393\n\u22c6\ni\ntj \u2261\u0393\n\u22c6\ni\njt, \u0393\n\u22c6\n\u03b1\n\u03bd\u00b5\u2261\u0393\n\u03b1\n(t)\u03bd\u00b5, (3)\nwhere \u0393\u03b1(t)\u03bd\u00b5 are the connection coefficients of the family \u2207t of Levi-Civita connections\ndefined from the collection of single Lorentzian metrics onM. The restriction of\n\u22c6\n\u2207 toN is\ntrivial since it does not involve any projections. (That is, to apply\n\u22c6\n\u2207 in N one just applies\nit in the sub-manifold x0 = ct in a GTCS.) Notice that other degenerate connection\ncoefficients than those given in equation (3) vanish identically. This implies that the\ngradient of the global time function is covariantly constant, i.e.,\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\ndt =\n\u22c6\n\u2207 \u2202\n\u2202x\u00b5\ndt = 0.\n5\nIt is in general possible to write gt as a sum of two terms\ngt = \u2212gt(nt, \u00b7)\u2297gt(nt, \u00b7) + ht. (4)\nThen equations (1) and (2) imply that\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\ngt = 0,\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\nht = 0, (5)\nthus the degenerate connection is compatible with (the non-degenerate part of) the metric\nfamily gt as asserted.\n2.2 General equations of motion\nNow we want to use the above defined affine structure on N to find equations of motion\nfor test particles in (N , gt). Let \u03bb be an affine parameter along the world line in N of\nan arbitrary test particle. (In addition to the affine parameter \u03bb, t is also a (non-affine)\nparameter along any non-space-like curve in N .) Using an arbitrary coordinate system\n(not necessarily a GTCS) we may define coordinate vector fields \u2202\n\u2202x\u03b1\n; then dt\nd\u03bb\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n+ dx\n\u03b1\nd\u03bb\n\u2202\n\u2202x\u03b1\nis the coordinate representation of the tangent vector field \u2202\n\u2202\u03bb\nalong the curve. We then\ndefine the degenerate covariant derivative along the curve as\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2261\ndt\nd\u03bb\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\n+\ndx\u03b1\nd\u03bb\n\u22c6\n\u2207 \u2202\n\u2202x\u03b1\n. (6)\nA particularly important family of vector fields is the 4-velocity tangent vector field family\nut along a curve. By definition we have\nut\u2261u\n\u03b1\n(t)\n\u2202\n\u2202x\u03b1\n\u2261\ndx\u03b1\nd\u03c4t\n\u2202\n\u2202x\u03b1\n, (7)\nwhere \u03c4t is the proper time as measured along the curve.\nThe equations of motion are found by calculating the covariant derivative of 4-velocity\ntangent vectors along themselves using the connection in (N , gt). According to the above,\nthis is equivalent to calculating\n\u22c6\n\u2207ut along\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c4t\n. Using the coordinate representation of\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c4t\nwe may thus define the vector field\n\u22c6\na by\n\u22c6\na\u2261\n\u22c6\n\u2207 \u2202\n\u2202\u03c4t\nut =\n( dt\nd\u03c4t\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\n+\ndx\u03b1\nd\u03c4t\n\u22c6\n\u2207 \u2202\n\u2202x\u03b1\n)\nut\u2261\ndt\nd\u03c4t\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\nut + at. (8)\nWe call this vector field the \u201cdegenerate\u201d 4-acceleration. We need to have an independent\nexpression for the degenerate acceleration field\n\u22c6\na. This can be found by calculating the\nextra term dt\nd\u03c4t\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\nut at the right hand side of equation (8). To do that, it is convenient\n6\nto introduce the 3-velocity wt of an arbitrary test particle as seen by the FOs. That is,\none may split up the tangent 4-velocity into parts respectively normal and tangential to\nthe FHSs, i.e.\nut =\n\u22c6\n\u03b3(cnt +wt),\n\u22c6\n\u03b3\u2261(1\u2212\nw2\nc2\n)\u22121/2 =\nd\u03c4F\nd\u03c4t\n, (9)\nwhere w2 is the square of wt and d\u03c4F\u2261Ndt is the proper time interval of the local FO.\nHere N is the lapse function field (as expressed in a GTCS) of the FOs. Note that wt is\nan object intrinsic to the FHSs since gt(nt,wt)\u22610. Moreover, from equation (5) we have\nthat\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\ngt(wt,wt) = 0, so w\n2 is independent of t. This result in combination with the\nconnection coefficients given in equation (3) yields h(t)ij\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\nwi(t) = 0 and thus\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\nwt = 0.\nThis means, using equations (2) and (9), that we in fact have\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u2202\n\u2202t\nut = 0 and thus\n\u22c6\na=at\nfrom equation (8). The coordinate expression for\n\u22c6\na then yields equations of motion,\nnamely\nd2x\u03b1\nd\u03bb2\n+\n(\n\u0393\n\u22c6\n\u03b1\nt\u03c3\ndt\nd\u03bb\n+\u0393\n\u22c6\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03c3\ndx\u03b2\nd\u03bb\n)dx\u03c3\nd\u03bb\n=\n(d\u03c4t\nd\u03bb\n)2\na\u03b1(t). (10)\nEquation (10) is the geodesic equation obtained from\n\u22c6\n\u2207 and this implies that inertial\ntest particles follow geodesics of\n\u22c6\n\u2207. Note that while the form of equation (10) is valid in\ngeneral coordinates, the form of \u0393\n\u22c6\n\u03b1\n\u00b5t given in equation (3) is not.\nFrom the general global dependence of g\u00aft and gt on t given in equation (13) below we\ncan find the coordinate expressions in a GTCS of nt and wt. These are given by [2]\nn0(t) = N\n\u22121, nj(t) = \u2212\nt0\nt\nN j(t)\nN\n, w0(t) = 0, w\nj\n(t) =\ndxj\nd\u03c4F\n+\nt0\nt\nN j(t)\nN\nc, (11)\nwhere the t0\nt\nN j(t) are the components in a GTCS of the shift vector field family of the\nFOs. Here t0 is just some arbitrary epoch setting the scale of the spatial coordinates.\nNote that N does not depend explicitly on t. Secondly, note that for equation (2) to\nhold, we must have that\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(t20\nt2\nN i(t)N\nj\n(t)h(t)ij\n)\n= 0, (12)\ndetermining the dependence of N j(t) on t. Thirdly, note that the proper time interval\nd\u03c4F\u2261Ndt may in principle be integrated along the world line of any FO given the implicit\ndependence N(x\u00b5(t)) in (N , gt). This means that there is a direct relationship between\nt and the proper time elapsed for any FO. So, since N is non-negative by definition, t\nmust be increasing in the forward direction of time for any FO.\n7\nTo get the correspondence with metric gravity, we formally set t0\nt\n= 1 and then take\nthe limit t\u2192\u221e in equations (3), (10) and (11). The equations of motion (10) then reduce\nto the usual geodesic equation in metric gravity. This limit represents the so-called metric\napproximation where the metric family gt does not depend on t. That is, in the metric\napproximation gt can be identified with one single Lorentzian metric g. Notice that\nin QMR, metric approximations are meaningful for isolated systems only. This is why\ncorrespondences between QMR and metric gravity can be found for, e.g., the solar system\nbut not for cosmology (see section 4).\nHowever, except for the metric approximation, gt should not be identified with any\nsingle Lorentzian metric and equation (10) does not reduce to the usual geodesic equation\nin metric gravity due to terms explicitly depending on t. That is, in QMR inertial test\nparticles do not move as if they were following geodesics of any single space-time metric.\nAlso note that the equations of motion (10) do not violate local Lorentz invariance. To\nsee this, observe that the connection coefficients may be made to vanish in any local\ninertial frame so that equation (10) takes its special relativistic form.\n3 Quasi-metric gravity\n3.1 Basic principles\nAt this point two questions naturally arise, namely\n\u2022 What is the role of t in the metric families gt and g\u00aft? and\n\u2022 Why should it be preferable to describe space-time by a metric family rather than\nby a single Lorentzian metric field?\nThe answer to the first question should be clear from the discussion in the previous\nsections. That is, by definition the main role of t in the metric families is to describe\nglobal scale changes of the FHSs as measured by the FOs. This means that t should enter\neach metric family explicitly as a spatial scale factor R(t). To avoid introducing any extra\narbitrary scale or parameter we just define R(t) = ct. (Further justification of this choice\nof scale factor will be given later in this section.) Moreover, the FHSs are by definition\ncompact to ensure the uniqueness of a global time coordinate. That is, by requiring the\nFHSs to be compact we ensure that t splits quasi-metric space-time into a unique set\nof FHSs. Besides, since there is no reason to introduce any nontrivial spatial topology,\nthe global basic geometry of the FHSs (neglecting the effects of gravity) should be that\nof the 3-sphere S3. But any restriction on the global geometry of the FHSs implies the\n8\nexistence of prior 3-geometry. This prior 3-geometry should not restrict the general form\nof the metric family explicitly though; rather it should be represented by specific terms\nin the field equations (see section 3.3).\nWe now set up the general form of the metric family g\u00aft, represented by the family of\nline elements ds\n2\nt , where the global dependence on t is included explicitly via the scale\nfactor mentioned above. That is, expressed in a suitable GTCS, the most general form\nallowed for the family g\u00aft may be represented by the family of line elements (we use the\nmetric signature (\u2212+++) and Einstein\u2019s summation convention throughout)\nds\n2\nt = N\u00af\n2\nt\n{\n[N\u00afk(t)N\u00af\ns\n(t)h\u02dc(t)ks \u2212 1](dx\n0)2 + 2\nt\nt0\nN\u00afk(t)h\u02dc(t)ksdx\nsdx0 +\nt2\nt20\nh\u02dc(t)ksdx\nkdxs\n}\n. (13)\nHere t0 is some arbitrary reference epoch (usually chosen to be the present epoch) set-\nting the scale of the spatial coordinates, N\u00aft is the family of lapse functions of the FOs\nand t0\nt\nN\u00afk(t) are the components of the shift vector family of the FOs in (N , g\u00aft). Also,\nh\u00af(t)ks\u2261\nt2\nt2\n0\nN\u00af2t h\u02dc(t)ks are the components of the spatial metric family h\u00aft intrinsic to the FHSs.\nWe notice that N\u00af2t enters equation (13) as a conformal factor, but that this does not\nimply any restrictions on the general form of g\u00aft. The only effect of the conformal factor\nis that the total scale factor of the FHSs may now be defined formally as F\u00aft\u2261N\u00aftct. We\nalso notice that N\u00aft may depend on t and that the form (13) of g\u00aft is preserved only under\ncoordinate transformations between GTCSs. Finally, we notice that the most general\nallowed metric approximation of g\u00aft is the single metric g\u00af obtained from equation (13)\nby setting t\nt0\n= 1 and eliminating all remaining t-dependence by making the substitution\nt = x0/c.\nAs mentioned earlier, to get the correct affine structure on (N , gt) one must separate\nbetween ct and x0 in gt. Similarly, to get the correct affine structure on (N , g\u00aft), one\nmust separate between ct and x0 in equation (13). But the possibility that N\u00aft depends\nexplicitly on t means that the affine structure on (N , g\u00aft) will differ slightly from that on\n(N , gt). That is, since counterparts to equations (2) and (5) must exist in (N , g\u00aft), i.e.,\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u00af\u2202\n\u2202t\ng\u00aft = 0,\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u00af\u2202\n\u2202t\nn\u00aft = 0,\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u00af\u2202\n\u2202t\nh\u00aft = 0, (14)\nthe potential t-dependence of N\u00aft implies that the degenerate connection coefficients in\n(N , g\u00aft) will not take a form exactly like that shown in equation (3). Rather, the in general\nnon-vanishing connection coefficients in (N , g\u00aft) are given in a GTCS by (a comma denotes\na partial derivative)\n\u0393\u00af\n\u22c6\n0\nt0 =\nN\u00aft,t\nN\u00aft\n, \u0393\u00af\n\u22c6\ni\ntj =\n(1\nt\n+\nN\u00aft,t\nN\u00aft\n)\n\u03b4ij +\n1\n2\nh\u02dcis(t)h\u02dc(t)sj,t, \u0393\u00af\n\u22c6\n\u03b1\nt\u00b5\u2261\u0393\u00af\n\u22c6\n\u03b1\n\u00b5t, \u0393\u00af\n\u22c6\n\u03b1\n\u03bd\u00b5\u2261\u0393\u00af\n\u03b1\n(t)\u03bd\u00b5. (15)\n9\nWe notice that, for equation (14) to hold, we must have (this is a counterpart to equation\n(12))\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\nN\u00af i(t)N\u00af\nj\n(t)h\u02dc(t)ij\n)\n= 0. (16)\nNext we want to describe the evolution of the total spatial scale factor F\u00aft of the FHSs in\nthe hypersurface-orthogonal direction. By definition we have (the symbol \u2018\u22a5\u00af\u2019 denotes a\nscalar product with \u2212n\u00aft)\nF\u00af\u22121t \u00a3\n\u22c6\nn\u00aftF\u00aft\u2261F\u00af\n\u22121\nt\n(\n(cN\u00aft)\n\u22121F\u00aft,t+\u00a3n\u00aftF\u00aft\n)\n= (cN\u00aft)\n\u22121\n[1\nt\n+\nN\u00aft,t\nN\u00aft\n]\n\u2212\nN\u00aft,\u22a5\u00af\nN\u00aft\n\u2261c\u22122x\u00aft + c\n\u22121H\u00aft, (17)\nwhere \u00a3n\u00aft denotes Lie derivation in the direction normal to the FHS, treating t as a\nconstant where it occurs explicitly. In equation (17), c\u22122x\u00aft represents the kinematical\ncontribution to the evolution of F\u00aft and c\n\u22121H\u00aft represents the so-called non-kinematical\ncontribution defined by\nH\u00aft\u2261\n1\nN\u00aftt\n+ y\u00aft, y\u00aft\u2261c\n\u22121\n\u221a\na\u00afFka\u00afkF , c\n\u22122a\u00afFj\u2261\nN\u00aft,j\nN\u00aft\n, (18)\nwhere a\u00afF is the 4-acceleration field of the FOs in the family g\u00aft. We see that the non-\nkinematical evolution (NKE) of the spatial scale factor takes the form of an \u201cexpansion\u201d\nsince H\u00aft can never take negative values. Furthermore we observe that H\u00aft does not\nvanish even if the kinematical evolution of F\u00aft does and N\u00aft is a constant in (N , g\u00aft).\nFor this particular case (see section 4, equation (52) below) we have the relationship\nH\u00aft =\n1\nN\u00aftt\n=\n\u221a\nP\u00aft\n6\nc, where P\u00aft is the Ricci scalar curvature intrinsic to the FHSs. This\nmeans that in quasi-metric relativity, a global increase in scale of the FHSs is linked to\ntheir global curvature. Moreover this global increase of scale has nothing to do with the\nkinematical structure described by any single Lorentzian metric field. It follows that in\nQMR, the Hubble law is not interpreted as a kinematical law, rather the Hubble law is\ninterpreted as evidence for global spatial curvature. This reinterpretation of the Hubble\nlaw also justifies the choice of a scale factor F\u00aft\u221dt since no other choice fulfils the above\nrelationship with H\u00aft playing the role of a \u201cHubble parameter\u201d for the special case when\nN\u00aft is a constant. In particular, notice that it is not possible to construct similar models\nwhere the global NKE takes the form of a \u201ccontraction\u201d without introducing some extra\narbitrary scale.\nIt follows from the above discussion that quasi-metric space-time is manifestly time-\nasymmetric by construction, irrespective of the fact that dynamical laws are time-reversal\ninvariant. That is, quasi-metric space-time is time-asymmetric regardless of whether\n10\nsolutions of dynamical equations are time-symmetric or not. For example, one may find\ntime-symmetric (e.g., static) solutions for N\u00aft in equation (13). But the scale factor is\nnever time-symmetric, as can be seen from equation (17). This illustrates that the global\ntime-asymmetry of quasi-metric space-time is due to the cosmological arrow of time\nrepresented by the global cosmic expansion. Moreover, the existence of a global arrow of\ntime means that quasi-metric space-time has a simple causal structure.\nThe answer to the second question we posed above is now clear. In order to construct\na new theory with considerably more predictive power than metric theory in cosmology, it\nwould seem necessary to describe the cosmic expansion as non-kinematical, i.e., as some\nsort of prior-geometric property of space-time itself. In this way an enormous multitude of\npossibilities regarding cosmic genesis and evolution will be eliminated just by postulating\nthat space-time is quasi-metric. This is why quasi-metric space-time should be preferred\nover Lorentzian space-time as a matter of principle as long as this position is not in\nconflict with observations.\n3.2 Units and measurement\nThe fact that QMR describes global scale changes of the FHSs as non-kinematical suggests\nthe existence of two fundamentally different scales in the Universe, one gravitational and\none atomic. This means that we have to specify which kind of units we are supposed to\nuse in equation (13). In metric theory it does not matter which kind of units one uses,\nbut in quasi-metric theory this is not so obvious. That is, is equation (13) equally valid in\nunits operationally defined from systems where gravitational interactions are dominant,\nas in operationally defined atomic units based on systems where gravitational interactions\nare insignificant? It turns out that the answer to this question is negative.\nThe units implicitly assumed when writing down line elements of the type (13) should\nbe \u201catomic\u201d units; i.e., units operationally defined by using atomic clocks and rods only.\nThis means that we may interpret the variation in space-time of the spatial scale fac-\ntor F\u00aft as a consequence of the fact that we use atomic units to measure gravitational\nscales. Equivalently we may interpret the variation of F\u00aft to mean that by definition, op-\nerationally defined atomic units are considered formally variable throughout space-time.\n(This interpretation is possible since any non-local inter-comparison of operationally de-\nfined units is purely a matter of definition.) The formal variation of atomic units in\nspace-time means that gravitational quantities get an extra formal variation when mea-\nsured in atomic units (and vice versa). (This shows up explicitly e.g. in differential laws\nsuch as local conservation laws.) We now postulate that atomic units vary in space-\n11\ntime just as the inverse of the spatial scale factor F\u00aft since this implies that the scale\nof the FHSs does not vary measured in gravitational units. That is, any gravitational\nquantity gets a formal variability as some power of F\u00aft when measured in atomic units.\nBy definition c and Planck\u2019s constant ~ are not formally variable (this yields no phys-\nical restrictions since, in the absence of other dimensionful quantities, c and ~ cannot\nbe combined to get a dimensionless number). This means that the formal variation of\natomic length and atomic time units are identical and inverse to that of atomic energy\n(or mass) units (charge units have no formal variation). One particular consequence of\nthis formal variability is that the \u201cbare\u201d gravitational coupling parameter GBt must be\nvariable when measured in atomic units.\nBy dimensional analysis it is found that GBt varies like coordinate length squared\nmeasured in atomic units (i.e., as F\u00af 2t ). Besides, G\nB\nt couples to charge squared, or more\ngenerally to the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor [4]. On the other hand, for mate-\nrial sources, masses formally vary as F\u00af\u22121t but this is not measurable in non-gravitational\nexperiments. This means that the \u201cscreened\u201d gravitational coupling parameter GSt mea-\nsured for material sources effectively varies as F\u00aft. Since G\nB\nt and G\nS\nt usually occur in\ncombination with charge or mass, it is convenient to define GBt and G\nS\nt to take the\nconstant values GB and GS, respectively, measured in (hypothetical) local gravitational\nexperiments in an empty universe at epoch t0. But if one does this, one must separate\nbetween active mass mt measured dynamically as a source of gravity and passive mass m\n(i.e., passive gravitational mass or inertial mass). (Similarly one must separate between\nactive charge and passive charge [4].) That is, we include the formal variation of GBt and\nGSt into mt. This means that the formal variation of active mass goes as F\u00aft for any ma-\nterial particle, whereas for the electromagnetic field, the formal variation of active mass\n(or energy) goes as F\u00af 2t . That is, active masses vary locally as\nmt =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nN\u00aftt\nN\u00af0t0\nm0, for material particles,\nN\u00af2t t\n2\nN\u00af2\n0\nt2\n0\nm0, , for the electromagnetic field,\n(19)\nwhere N\u00af0 and m0 denote values at some arbitrary reference event. (Formal variations of\nother gravitational quantities may be found similarly.) By convention we choose N\u00af0 = 1;\nthis means that the (hypothetical) reference situation is an empty Universe at epoch t0\n(see section 4). A consequence of equation (19) is that local gravitational experiments\ndesigned to measure gravitational coupling parameters should depend on source compo-\nsition, so that it will be necessary to distinguish between GB and GS.\nHowever, the electromagnetic field also in principle experiences a cosmic \u201credshift\u201d-\neffect (not noticeable locally) and also gravitational spectral shifts [4]; these spectral\n12\nshifts yield an extra factor F\u00af\u22121t . So, if an extended gravitational source is expanding (as\nfor, e.g., a gravitationally bound source made of ideal gas [5]), one must take into account\nboth the formal variation of active mass and the cosmic \u201credshift\u201d of the electromagnetic\nfield. For this case, the variation due to both said effects of the total active stress-energy\ntensor Tt (considered as a source of gravitation) goes as F\u00af\n\u22122\nt if one can neglect net\nenergy transfer between the electromagnetic field and material particles. (But in general\nthere will be thermal contact between photons and material particles, so that the cosmic\nexpansion cools the photons again cooling the material particles via thermal contact.\nThis means that the active electromagnetic stress-energy tensor T\n(EM)\nt will decrease a\nlittle more slowly than\nt2\n0\nt2\nand that the active material particle stress-energy tensor T\n(EM)\nt\nwill decrease a little faster than\nt2\n0\nt2\n.) On the other hand, if the gravitational source\ndoes not expand (as for, e.g., a solid hollow cavity filled with ideal gas), the fact that\nmaterial sources and the electromagnetic field have different formal variations of active\nmass-energy means that T\n(EM)\nt and T\nmat\nt will have very different secular evolutions.\nNote that the necessity to separate between gravitational and atomic scales represents\na violation of the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP). Also note that, since F\u00aft is a\nconstant in the Newtonian limit, Newtonian theory with a formally variable GSt (or G\nB\nt )\nwill be inconsistent with the Newtonian limit of QMR.\n3.3 Field equations\nNow we must find field equations which represent couplings between space-time geometry\nand the active stress-energy tensors T\n(EM)\nt and T\nmat\nt for the electromagnetic field and\nmaterial sources, with the two different coupling constants GB and GS, respectively. It\nwould seem natural to look for field equations with structure somewhat similar to that\nof the Einstein field equations. However, apart from the non-universal gravitational\ncoupling, there should also be other significant differences.\nFirst, QMR describes the time evolution of one distinguished foliation of space-time\ninto spatial hypersurfaces, i.e., the FHSs. The field equations must be tailored to this\nparticular foliation and not to alternative foliations. In fact, the distinguished foliation\nshould be determined as part of any solution of the field equations. But this means that\nthe field equations cannot involve \u201cgenuine\u201d space-time tensors only; also some geometric\ntensor stemming from the distinguished foliation must be included. Second, in contrast\nto GR, in quasi-metric gravity we have so-called \u201cprior\u201d geometry, i.e., non-dynamical\naspects of the space-time geometry which are not influenced by matter sources. This is\nso since we have restricted the metric family g\u00aft by requiring that the \u201cbasic\u201d geometry\n13\nof the FHSs should be that of the 3-sphere. This prior geometry should be represented\nby specific terms in the field equations.\nFortunately, it is possible to avoid the above concerns for a subset of the field equa-\ntions, yielding a metric correspondence with GR (and Newtonian theory), in a natural,\ngeometrical way. That is, we postulate one field equation valid for projections with\nrespect to the FHSs, namely (using a GTCS)\n2R\u00af(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af = 2(c\n\u22122a\u00afiF|i + c\n\u22124a\u00afFia\u00af\ni\nF \u2212 K\u00af(t)ikK\u00af\nik\n(t) +\u00a3n\u00aftK\u00aft)\n= \u03baB(T\n(EM)\n(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af\n+ T\u02c6\n(EM)i\n(t)i ) + \u03ba\nS(Tmat(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af + T\u02c6\nmati\n(t)i ), (20)\nwhere R\u00aft is the Ricci tensor family and K\u00aft is the extrinsic curvature tensor family (with\ntrace K\u00aft) of the FHSs. Moreover \u03ba\nB\u22618\u03c0GB/c4, \u03baS\u22618\u03c0GS/c4, a \u201chat\u201d denotes an object\nprojected into the FHSs and the symbol \u2018|\u2019 denotes a spatial covariant derivative. The\nvalues of GB and GS are by convention chosen as those measured in (hypothetical) local\ngravitational experiments in an empty Universe at epoch t0. Note that a\u00afF is an object\nintrinsic to the FHSs. Also note that all quantities correspond to the metric family g\u00aft.\nA second set of field equations yielding a natural correspondence with GR is (in a\nGTCS)\nR\u00af(t)j\u22a5\u00af = K\u00af\ni\n(t)j|i \u2212 K\u00aft,j = \u03ba\nBT\n(EM)\n(t)j\u22a5\u00af\n+ \u03baSTmat(t)j\u22a5\u00af, (21)\nagain valid for projections with respect to the FHSs. Except for the non-universal cou-\npling, the field equations (20) and (21) are similar to a subset of the projected Einstein\nfield equations in ordinary GR.\nTo get any further and find the rest of the wanted field equations, it is useful to\nidentify the cases where we can set N\u00afk(t) = 0 and h\u02dc(t)ks = Sks in equation (13), where\nSksdx\nkdxs is the metric of the 3-sphere (with radius equal to ct0). For these cases, g\u00aft is\nconformal to a metric family with geometry S3\u00d7R. The latter is metrically static, i.e., it\nis static except for the global time dependence of the spatial geometry on t. The special\ncase where N\u00aft = 1 is a vacuum solution of equation (20); in fact this solution represents\nan empty universe (see section 4.1). More generally, if N\u00aft has no time dependence, g\u00aft\nwill be metrically static as well, and the extrinsic curvature will vanish, i.e., K\u00aft = 0. We\nnow identify these metrically static cases with vacuum solutions, where g\u00aft is determined\nsolely from N\u00aft. Such solutions are thus fully determined from the scale factor F\u00aft.\nFor said metrically static vacua we may straightforwardly find expressions for the\nspatial Einstein tensor family H\u00aft and for the spatial Ricci scalar family P\u00aft intrinsic to\nthe FHSs in (N , g\u00aft). We calculate\nH\u00af(t)ij \u2212 c\n\u22122\n(\na\u00afkF|k \u2212\n1\nN\u00af2t t\n2\n)\nh\u00af(t)ij + c\n\u22124a\u00afFia\u00afFj + c\n\u22122a\u00afFi|j = 0. (22)\n14\nMoreover, contracting equation (22) and then using equation (20) for a metrically static\nvacuum to eliminate any dependence on c\u22122a\u00afiF|i, we also find\nP\u00aft \u2212 6c\n\u22124a\u00afFka\u00af\nk\nF \u2212\n6\n(N\u00aftct)2\n= 0. (23)\nHere, any dependence on c\u22122a\u00afiF|i has been eliminated in order to isolate P\u00aft as the dominant\nterm in equation (23) (for weak fields) and thereby get a counterpart to the twice normal-\nprojected Einstein equation for vacuum (see equation (29) below). Equations (22) and\n(23) should follow from the wanted field equations for the special case of a metrically\nstatic vacuum.\nWe now postulate what the wanted field equations should look like for the more\ngeneral case when we have a metrically static nonzero source. (As opposed to metrically\nstatic vacua, we now have h\u02dc(t)ks 6=Sks, but the metric family (13) is still metrically static.)\nTo do that, we require that except for opposite signs, the dependences on P\u00aft and H\u00af(t)ij\nshould be as for the projected Einstein equations. (The opposite signs are necessary due\nto said conformal form of metrically static vacua.) We thus find, generalizing equations\n(22) and (23) to metrically static cases with nonvanishing Tt, that\n\u2212\n1\n2\nP\u00aft + 3c\n\u22124a\u00afFka\u00af\nk\nF +\n3\n(N\u00aftct)2\n= \u03baBT\n(EM)\n(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af\n+ \u03baSTmat(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af, (24)\n\u2212H\u00af(t)ij + c\n\u22122\n(\na\u00afkF|k \u2212\n1\nN\u00af2t t\n2\n)\nh\u00af(t)ij \u2212 c\n\u22124a\u00afFia\u00afFj \u2212 c\n\u22122a\u00afFi|j = \u03ba\nBT\n(EM)\n(t)ij + \u03ba\nSTmat(t)ij . (25)\nEquations (24) and (25) may be rewritten in terms of projections of the Einstein ten-\nsor family G\u00aft (use equations (29) and (30) below with vanishing extrinsic curvature).\nMoreover, using equation (20) for a metrically static nonzero source we then get\nG\u00af(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af = \u2212\n1\n2\n(\n\u03baBT\n(EM)\n(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af\n\u2212 \u03baBT\u02c6 (EM)s(t)s + \u03ba\nSTmat(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af \u2212 \u03ba\nST\u02c6mats(t)s\n)\n+ X\u00af(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af, (26)\nG\u00af(t)ij =\n1\n2\n(\n\u03baBT\n(EM)\n(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af\n+ \u03baBT\u02c6\n(EM)s\n(t)s + \u03ba\nSTmat(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af + \u03ba\nST\u02c6mats(t)s\n)\nh\u00af(t)ij\n\u2212\u03baBT (EM)(t)ij \u2212 \u03ba\nSTmat(t)ij + X\u00af(t)ij . (27)\nHere, X\u00aft is a geometric tensor stemming from the particular foliation of quasi-metric\nspace-time into the distinguished set of space-like hypersurfaces, i.e., the FHSs. Note\nthat, to be compatible with equations (20) and (21), we must have\nX\u00af(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af +\n\u02c6\u00afX\ni\n(t)i\u22610, X\u00af(t)\u22a5\u00afj = X\u00af(t)j\u22a5\u00af\u22610. (28)\nWe now postulate that equations (26) and (27) should be valid in general, so these\nequations constitute the wanted field equations. For the general case, we have (see e.g.,\n[2] and references therein)\nG\u00af(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af =\n1\n2\n(P\u00aft + K\u00af\n2\nt \u2212 K\u00af(t)mnK\u00af\nmn\n(t) ), (29)\nG\u00af(t)ij = \u2212\n1\nN\u00aft\nLN\u00aftn\u00aft(K\u00af(t)ij \u2212 K\u00afth\u00af(t)ij) + 3K\u00aftK\u00af(t)ij \u2212\n1\n2\n(K\u00af2t + K\u00af(t)mnK\u00af\nmn\n(t) )h\u00af(t)ij\n\u22122K\u00af(t)isK\u00af\ns\n(t)j \u2212 c\n\u22122a\u00afFi|j \u2212 c\n\u22124a\u00afFia\u00afFj + (c\n\u22122a\u00afsF|s + c\n\u22124a\u00afsF a\u00afFs)h\u00af(t)ij + H\u00af(t)ij , (30)\nwhere Ln\u00aft is a projected Lie derivative in the normal direction to the FHSs. Notice that\nLn\u00aft operates only on objects intrinsic to the FHSs.\nIt remains to find the dependence on K\u00aft of X\u00aft. To do that, we consider the general-\nization of the left hand side of equation (24) to cases with nonzero extrinsic curvature.\nThat is, we require that the left hand side of equation (24) will have the same dependence\non terms quadratic in extrinsic curvature as does the right hand side of equation (29),\nbut with opposite signs. With this requirement, X\u00af(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af is determined uniquely, i.e.,\nX\u00af(t)\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af\u2261K\u00af(t)mnK\u00af\nmn\n(t) \u2212 c\n\u22122a\u00afsF|s + 2c\n\u22124a\u00afFsa\u00af\ns\nF +\n3\n(ctN\u00aft)2\n. (31)\nTaking into account equation (28), and requiring that the dependence of X\u00af(t)ij on terms\nquadratic in extrinsic curvature should not involve h\u00af(t)ij explicitly, X\u00af(t)ij is determined\nuniquely as well. We thus have\nX\u00af(t)ij\u2261\u2212 K\u00af(t)isK\u00af\ns\n(t)j \u2212 2c\n\u22122a\u00afFi|j \u2212 2c\n\u22124a\u00afFia\u00afFj +\n(\nc\u22122a\u00afsF|s \u2212\n1\n(ctN\u00aft)2\n)\nh\u00af(t)ij . (32)\nThe full set of quasi-metric field equations then consists of equations (21), (26) and (27)\n(equation (20) is not an independent field equation). Note that these field equations are\nvalid only for projections with respect to the FHSs; they do not hold for projections\nwith respect to any other hypersurfaces. This is a consequence of the presence of the\ngeometric tensor family X\u00aft, which is not a \u201cgenuine\u201d space-time tensor family. Contrary\nto this, in GR the projected Einstein field equations are valid with respect foliations of\nspace-time into arbitrary spatial hypersurfaces; this is a direct result of the fact that\nthe Einstein tensor is a genuine space-time tensor. Notice that the field equations have\nthe same split-up as Einstein\u2019s field equations into dynamical equations and constraints.\nThat is, equations (21) and (26) are constraint equations while equation (27) is the\ndynamical equation. Similar to Einstein\u2019s equations, the dynamical field is the extrinsic\ncurvature family K\u00aft, representing two independent propagating dynamical degrees of\nfreedom. Finally, we notice that all field equations are time-reversal invariant.\n16\n3.4 Local conservation laws\nWithin the metric framework one usually just substitutes partial derivatives with covari-\nant derivatives when generalizing differential laws from flat to curved space-time. In fact,\nthis rule in the form \u201ccomma goes to semicolon\u201d follows directly from the EEP in most\nmetric theories [1]. But in quasi-metric theory it is possible to couple non-gravitational\nfields to first derivatives of the scale factor of the FHSs such that the EEP still holds.\nThat is, any coupling of non-gravitational fields to the fields a\u00afFj ,\nN\u00aft,\u22a5\u00af\nN\u00aft\n, N\u00aft,t\nN\u00aft\nand 1\nt\nmay be\nmade to vanish in the local inertial frames so that these couplings do not interfere with\nthe local non-gravitational physics.\nIn particular, the EEP implies that the local conservation laws take the form\u2207\u00b7T = 0\nin any metric theory based on an invariant action principle, independent of the field\nequations [1]. The reason why the conservation laws must take this form is that they\nthen imply that inertial test particles move on geodesics of the metric. So, in said metric\ntheories, the above form of the local conservation laws is sufficient to ensure that they\nare consistent with the equations of motion. But in quasi-metric theory, consistency with\nthe equations of motion does not necessarily imply that the local conservation laws take\nthe form shown above. This fact, in addition to the possibility of extra couplings between\nnon-gravitational fields and the fields a\u00afFj ,\nN\u00aft,\u22a5\u00af\nN\u00aft\n, N\u00aft,t\nN\u00aft\nand 1\nt\n, means that the EEP does not\nnecessarily imply a form similar to \u2207\u00b7T = 0 of the local conservation laws in quasi-metric\ntheory. That is, the divergence\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u00af\u00b7Tt will in general not vanish, so the EEP is insufficient\nto determine the form of the local conservation laws in QMR.\nSince the EEP is not sufficient to determine the form of the local conservation laws in\nquasi-metric theory we have to deduce their form from other criteria. That is, in order to\nhave the correct Newtonian limit in addition to being consistent with electromagnetism\ncoupled to gravity [4], the local conservation laws (with t fixed) must take the form\nT \u03bd(t)\u00b5;\u03bd = 2\nN\u00aft,\u03bd\nN\u00aft\nT \u03bd(t)\u00b5 = 2c\n\u22122a\u00afFiT\u02c6\ni\n(t)\u00b5 \u2212 2\nN\u00aft,\u22a5\u00af\nN\u00aft\nT(t)\u22a5\u00af\u00b5, (33)\nwhere a semicolon denotes a metric covariant derivative in component notation. More-\nover, for the nonmetric part of the connection, i.e., as a counterpart to equation (33),\nan extra local \u201cconservation law\u201d can be found by calculating the quantity c\u22121\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u00af\u2202\n\u2202t\nT 0(t)\u00b5.\nAssuming that the t-dependence of Tt can be found from the special case of an expanding\nsource consisting of noninteracting particles and fields (see section 3.2), we find\nT 0(t)\u00b5\u2217\u00aft = \u2212\n2\nN\u00aft\n(1\nt\n+\nN\u00aft,t\nN\u00aft\n)\nT(t)\u22a5\u00af\u00b5, (34)\n17\nwhere the symbol \u2018\u2217\u00af\u2019 denotes a degenerate covariant derivative compatible with the metric\nfamily g\u00aft. By applying equation (33) to a source consisting of a perfect fluid with no pres-\nsure (i.e., dust), and projecting the resulting equations with the quantity g\u00aft + c\n\u22122u\u00aft\u2297u\u00aft,\nwe find that the dust particles move on geodesics of\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u00af in (N , g\u00aft). (It is sufficient to use\nequation (33) since we have the counterpart in (N , g\u00aft) to equation (8) with\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u00af\u2202\n\u2202t\nu\u00aft = 0.)\nThis guarantees that the dust particles move on geodesics of\n\u22c6\n\u2207 in (N , gt) as well; see\nsection 3.5 for justification. Besides, since Tt is the active stress-energy tensor and since\nno extra field independent of g\u00aft couples to gravitating bodies in QMR, this result should\napply even to (sufficiently small) dust particles with significant self-gravitational energy\nand not only to test particles. This means that, although GBt and G\nS\nt are formally variable\nin QMR, no Nordtvedt effect should be associated with this formal variability.\nSince Tt is not directly measurable locally one must know how it relates to the passive\nstress-energy tensor Tt in (N , gt), or equivalently, to the passive stress-energy tensor T\u00aft in\n(N , g\u00aft) (which can be measured locally using atomic units). This means that equations\n(33) and (34) do not represent the \u201cmore physical\u201d local conservation laws involving\nTt. Besides, the local conservation laws shown in (33), (34) are compatible with g\u00aft\nand not with gt. However, said more physical local conservation laws can be found by\ncalculating\n\u22c6\n\u2207\u00b7Tt when gt is known. But these more physical local conservation laws take\nno predetermined form.\nThe relationship between Tt and Tt (or T\u00aft) depends in principle explicitly on the\ngeneral nature of the matter source. For example, this relationship will be different for\na perfect fluid consisting of material particles than for electromagnetic radiation. To\nillustrate this we may consider Tt for a perfect fluid:\nTt = (\u02dc\u033am + c\n\u22122p\u02dc)u\u00aft\u2297u\u00aft + p\u02dcg\u00aft, (35)\nwhere \u02dc\u033am is the active mass-energy density in the local rest frame of the fluid and p\u02dc is\nthe active pressure. The corresponding expressions for Tt and T\u00aft are\nTt =\n\u221a\nh\u00aft\nht\n[\n(\u033am + c\n\u22122p)ut\u2297ut + pgt\n]\n, T\u00aft = (\u033am + c\n\u22122p)u\u00aft\u2297u\u00aft + pg\u00aft, (36)\nwhere \u033am is the passive mass-energy density as measured in the local rest frame of the\nfluid and p is the passive pressure. Also, by definition h\u00aft and ht are the determinants of\nh\u00aft and ht, respectively. Now the relationship between \u02dc\u033am and \u033am is given by\n\u033am =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nt0\nt\nN\u00af\u22121t \u02dc\u033am, for a fluid of material particles,\nt2\n0\nt2\nN\u00af\u22122t \u02dc\u033am, for electromagnetic radiation,\n(37)\n18\nand a similar relationship exists between p\u02dc and p. The reason why the relationship\nbetween \u02dc\u033am and \u033am is different for the electromagnetic field than for material fluid sources,\nis that the cosmological redshift directly influences passive electromagnetic mass-energy\nbut not the passive mass-energy of a material fluid.\n3.5 Constructing gt from g\u00aft\nThe global part of the NKE is realized explicitly in the evolution of F\u00aft, as can be seen\nfrom equation (17). But from equation (18) we see that spatial derivatives of N\u00aft yield\nlocal contributions to the NKE of the FHSs as well. These local contributions are not\nrealized explicitly in the evolution of F\u00aft, so whenever y\u00aft 6=0 in equation (18), it is necessary\nto construct a new metric family gt. In what follows we will see the reason why.\nThe question now is just how the metric family (13) should be modified to include\nthe local effects of the NKE. This question can be answered by noticing that according to\nequation (18), the local effects of the NKE should take the form of an \u201cexpansion\u201d that\nvaries from place to place. That is, the tangent spaces of the FHSs should experience\na varying degree of expansion as a consequence of the local contribution y\u00aft to H\u00aft. Two\npoints now are, that the local contribution y\u00aft to the expansion is due to gravitation,\nand that this contribution is not reflected explicitly in the evolution of the scale factor\nF\u00aft as can be seen from equation (17). Thus, whenever y\u00aft is nonzero we may think of\nchange of distances in any tangent space of the FHSs as consisting of an expansion plus a\ncontraction. That is, the FOs seem to \u201cmove\u201d more than the explicit change of F\u00aft would\nindicate. The modification of the metric family (13) then consists of a compensation for\nthis extra gravitationally induced \u201cmotion\u201d.\nTo have a consistent transformation g\u00aft\u2192gt we need to treat the effects of the extra\ngravitationally induced \u201cmotion\u201d in each tangent space, i.e., locally. To do that, it turns\nout that we need to define a 3-vector field bF representing the coordinate distance to a\nlocal fictitious \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d in each tangent space. This is necessary to be able\nto define a family of 3-vector fields vt telling how much the FOs in each tangent space\n\u201crecede\u201d from the local \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d due to the gravitationally induced expansion.\nBesides, since the coordinate positions of all FOs must be unaffected, the FOs must\nsimultaneously \u201cfall\u201d with velocity \u2212vt toward the local \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d to cancel out\nthe \u201crecession\u201d. And the extra \u201cmotion\u201d involved induces corrections in the coordinate\nlength and time intervals as perceived by any FO. That is, the metric components of\nequation (13) in a GTCS must be modified to yield a new metric family gt.\nIn the special case where g\u00aft is spherically symmetric with respect to one distinguished\n19\npoint, the spatial coordinates of this point represent a natural local \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d in\neach tangent space of the FHSs. In this case we obviously have bF = r\n\u2202\n\u2202r\nexpressed in a\nspherical polar GTCS where the distinguished point lies at the origin. It seems reasonable\nto seek for an equation defining bF which yields this solution for the spherically symmetric\ncase. Furthermore, the wanted equation should be linear in bF to ensure unique solutions,\nand it should involve a\u00afF since any deviation from spherical symmetry will be encoded\ninto a\u00afF and its spatial derivatives. By inspection of the spherically symmetric case, it\nturns out that it is possible to find an equation which has all the desired properties,\nnamely [\na\u00afkF|k + c\n\u22122a\u00afFka\u00af\nk\nF\n]\nbjF \u2212\n[\na\u00afjF|k + c\n\u22122a\u00afFka\u00af\nj\nF\n]\nbkF \u2212 2a\u00af\nj\nF = 0. (38)\nWith bF defined from equation (38) we are now able to define the 3-vector family vt.\nExpressed in a GTCS, the vector field family vt by definition has the components [2]\nvj(t)\u2261y\u00aftb\nj\nF , v = y\u00aft\n\u221a\nh\u00af(t)ikb\ni\nFb\nk\nF , (39)\nwhere v is the norm of vt. Notice that v is required not to depend explicitly on t.\nTherefore, any dependence on t of v must be eliminated by setting t = x0/c where it\noccurs.\nNow gt is constructed algebraically from g\u00aft and v. To do that, we first include the\neffects of the gravitationally induced expansion as seen from new observers which do not\nexperience this extra expansion, they are by definition \u201cat rest\u201d. This yields a correction\nto spatial intervals in the bF -direction due to the radial Doppler effect, the correction\nfactor being\n(\n1+ v\nc\n1\u2212 v\nc\n)1/2\n. There is also an inverse time dilation correction factor (1\u2212 v\n2\nc2\n)1/2\nto coordinate time intervals. There are no correction factors for spatial intervals normal\nto the bF -direction. Second, the coordinate intervals for the said new observers get an\nidentical pair of correction factors when compared to observers (now by definition \u201cat\nrest\u201d) moving with relative velocity \u2212vt.\nTo define transformation formulae, it is convenient to define the unit vector field\ne\u00afb\u2261\nt0\nt\ne\u00afib\n\u2202\n\u2202xi\nand the corresponding covector field e\u00afb\u2261 t\nt0\ne\u00afbidx\ni along bF . Since it is in\ngeneral not possible or practical to construct a GTCS where e\u00afb is parallel to one of\nthe coordinate vector fields, one expects that the transformation formulae defining the\ntransformation g\u00aft\u2192gt should involve components of e\u00afb. Requiring correspondence with\nthe spherically symmetric case one finds [2]\ng(t)00 =\n(\n1\u2212\nv2\nc2\n)2\ng\u00af(t)00, (40)\n20\ng(t)0j =\n(\n1\u2212\nv2\nc2\n)[\ng\u00af(t)0j +\nt\nt0\n2v\nc\n1\u2212 v\nc\n(e\u00afibN\u00af(t)i)e\u00af\nb\nj\n]\n, (41)\ng(t)ij = g\u00af(t)ij +\nt2\nt20\n4v\nc\n(1\u2212 v\nc\n)2\ne\u00afbi e\u00af\nb\nj . (42)\nNotice that we have eliminated any possible t-dependence of N\u00aft in equations (40)-(42)\nby setting t = x0/c where it occurs. This implies that N does not depend explicitly on t.\nSome tensor fields are required to preserve their norm under the transformation de-\nfined in equations (40)-(42). One particular example of this is the transformation F\u00aft\u2192Ft\nof the passive electromagnetic field tensor family F\u00aft in (N , g\u00aft) to its counterpart Ft in\n(N , gt), where the latter enters into the Lorentz force law [4]. This suggests that the\ntransformation g\u00aft\u2192gt defined in equations (40)-(42) is only a particular case of a more\ngeneral transformation. That is, transformations similar to g\u00aft\u2192gt should apply to any\ntensor field which norm is required to be unchanged when g\u00aft\u2192gt. As an example we\nlist the formulae defining the transformation Z\u00aft\u2192Zt where Z\u00aft is a rank one tensor field\nfamily. (Z\u00aft may, e.g., be identified with a general 4-velocity vector family u\u00aft.) These\nformulae read\nZ(t)0 =\n(\n1\u2212\nv2\nc2\n)\nZ\u00af(t)0, Z\n0\n(t) =\n(\n1\u2212\nv2\nc2\n)\u22121\nZ\u00af0(t), (43)\nZ(t)j = Z\u00af(t)j +\n2v\nc\n1\u2212 v\nc\n(e\u00afibZ\u00af(t)i)e\u00af\nb\nj, Z\u02c6\nj\n(t) =\n\u02c6\u00afZ\nj\n(t) \u2212\n2v\nc\n1 + v\nc\n(e\u00afbi\n\u02c6\u00afZ\ni\n(t))e\u00af\nj\nb. (44)\nIt is possible to find similar transformation formulae valid for higher rank tensor field\nfamilies. For illustrative purposes we also list formulae valid for the transformation\nW\u00aft\u2192Wt, where W\u00aft is a rank two tensor field family. These formulae read\nW(t)00 =\n(\n1\u2212\nv2\nc2\n)2\nW\u00af(t)00, W\n00\n(t) =\n(\n1\u2212\nv2\nc2\n)\u22122\nW\u00af 00(t) , (45)\nW(t)0j =\n(\n1\u2212\nv2\nc2\n)[\nW\u00af(t)0j +\n2v\nc\n1\u2212 v\nc\n(e\u00afibW\u00af(t)0i)e\u00af\nb\nj\n]\n,\nW\u02c6 0j(t) =\n(\n1\u2212\nv2\nc2\n)\u22121[\n\u02c6\u00afW\n0j\n(t) \u2212\n2v\nc\n1 + v\nc\n(e\u00afbi\n\u02c6\u00afW\n0i\n(t))e\u00af\nj\nb\n]\n, (46)\nW(t)ij = W\u00af(t)ij +\n2v\nc\n(1\u2212 v\nc\n)2\ne\u00afkb (e\u00af\nb\niW\u00af(t)kj + W\u00af(t)ik e\u00af\nb\nj),\nW\u02c6 ij(t) =\n\u02c6\u00afW\nij\n(t) \u2212\n2v\nc\n(1 + v\nc\n)2\ne\u00afbk(e\u00af\ni\nb\n\u02c6\u00afW\nkj\n(t) +\n\u02c6\u00afW\nik\n(t)e\u00af\nj\nb). (47)\n21\nThese transformation formulae may easily be generalized to tensor field families of higher\nrank. Notice that it is also possible to find formulae for the inverse transformations\nZt\u2192Z\u00aft, Wt\u2192W\u00aft and similarly for tensor field families of higher rank.\nSince both u\u00aft and F\u00aft transform according to the rules (43)-(47), so must any 4-\nacceleration a\u00aft resulting from the Lorentz force acting on charged matter. This implies\nthat the norm of a\u00aft must be invariant under the transformation. Since this result should\napply to all 4-accelerations determined from non-gravitational forces and since such forces\nmay in particular vanish, we may deduce that geodesic motion in (N , g\u00aft) implies geodesic\nmotion in (N , gt). That is, any inertial observer in (N , g\u00aft) must be inertial in (N , gt) as\nwell. Notice that the 4-acceleration field a\u00afF does not in general transform according to\nthe rules (43)-(44) since a\u00afF is determined from the requirement that the FOs must move\nnormal to the FHSs rather than from some non-gravitational force acting on the FOs.\nThe vector field family vt is an extra dynamical field constructed from g\u00aft and the\ndistinguished foliation of (N , g\u00aft) into spatial hypersurfaces. This means that vt is not an\nindependent dynamical field; however the dynamics represented by vt is implicit inasmuch\nas it is not explicitly coupled to matter fields. Moreover, since it can be calculated on\neach FHS from already known quantities there, vt does not represent any propagating\ndynamical degree of freedom. That is, unlike K\u00aft, which dynamical evolution is present\nexplicitly in the field equations, no such explicit presence exists for vt.\nWe close this section by emphasizing that gt is the \u201cphysical\u201d metric family in the\nsense that gt should be used consequently when comparing predictions of QMR to ex-\nperiments. That is, any laws given in terms of g\u00aft and its associated connection, e.g.\nthe local conservation laws defined in equation (33), are not the \u201cphysical\u201d laws; those\nmust always be in terms of gt and its associated connection when comparing directly to\nexperiment. Nevertheless it is sometimes necessary to use the laws in terms of g\u00aft and\nits associated connection. For example, to be able to calculate g\u00aft it is in general neces-\nsary to use the local conservation laws (33). But as long as one is aware of the correct\nrelationship between laws and observables this should not represent any problem.\n3.6 Comparing theory to experiment\nTo be able to compare the predictions of quasi-metric theory to experiment, it would be\nuseful to have available some systematic weak field approximation method similar to the\nparametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism developed for metric theories of gravity.\nIt is not a good idea to try to apply the standard PPN-formalism to our quasi-metric\ntheory, however. There are several reasons for this; one obvious reason is that the PPN-\n22\nformalism neglects the non-metric aspects of QMR. This means that any PPN-analysis\nof our field equations is limited to their metric approximations. But even these metric\napproximations are not suitable for a standard PPN-analysis since the resulting PPN-\nmetric g\u00af (the t-labels are omitted everywhere when dealing with metric approximations)\nis not the one to which experiments are to be compared, and g\u00af will not have an acceptable\nset of PPN-parameters according to metric theory. For example, a PPN-analysis of our\nfield equations yields the PPN-parameters \u03b3 = \u22121 and \u03b2 = 0; both values are totally\nunacceptable for any viable metric theory.\nBesides, finding a more complete set of PPN-parameters for g\u00af turns out to be prob-\nlematic. The main reason for this is that, within the standard PPN-framework, there\nis no way to parametrize the effects of the special quasi-metric feature of a \u201cpreferred\u201d\ndynamical foliation of quasi-metric space-time into spatial hypersurfaces. For example,\nwithin the standard PPN-framework, matter velocities are coordinate velocities relative\nto the standard PPN coordinate system [1]. But these velocities will in general differ\nfrom their QMR counterparts showing up in the projections of T. That is, since u\u00aft is\nrelated to w\u00aft in (N , g\u00aft) via an equation similar to equation (9), the projections of T will\ninvolve the velocities w\u00af relative to the FOs rather than velocities relative to any coor-\ndinate system. (This difference could be interpreted as due to the existence of a local\n\u201cpreferred frame\u201d. On the other hand, the \u201cpreferred frame\u201d effects implemented into\nthe PPN-formalism are those associated with velocities relative to the global rest frame of\nthe Universe [1]. No such effects are present in QMR.) Moreover, the differences between\nQMR and metric gravity regarding the implementation of the EEP show up via the local\nconservation laws (33) since even in the metric approximation, these laws are different\nfrom their counterparts in standard metric theory. This means that, any constraints on\nthe PPN-parameters deduced from integral conservation laws [1] will not necessarily hold\nin QMR.\nAll of the above implies that any further analysis of the field equations to find a\ncomplete set of PPN-parameters for g\u00af would be meaningless. Furthermore, when one\nattempts to construct a \u201cphysical\u201d PPN-metric g from g\u00af in the manner discussed in the\nprevious section one gets more complications. In particular, the isotropic PPN coordinate\nsystem is not invariant under the transformation g\u00af\u2192g. That is, isotropic coordinates\nfor the metric g are different from the isotropic coordinates one started out with in the\nfirst place when solving the field equations! The reason for this is, of course, that the\nconstruction of isotropic coordinates depends on the metric. But the main problem here\nis that the PPN-formalism does not tackle properly the construction of g from g\u00af. That\nis, the PPN-formalism exclusively handles explicit gravitational dynamics represented by\n23\nfield equations and neglects the possible existence of implicit dynamics as represented by\nthe velocity field v. Consequently, the PPN-metric g may contain terms which do not\noccur in the PPN-metric obtained from any metric theory with only explicit gravitational\ndynamics. Thus the bottom line is that a standard PPN-analysis, even limited to metric\napproximations of QMR, will fail.\nSo fact is that, to be able to compare the predictions of our theory to gravitational\nexperiments performed in the solar system in a satisfactory way, a separate weak-field\nexpansion similar to the PPN-formalism should be developed. And since such a formalism\nis lacking at this point in time it is not yet clear whether or not quasi-metric theory is\nviable. However, if a separate formalism is developed it should have some correspondence\nwith the PPN-formalism to answer this question (minimizing the need for reanalyzing\nweak-field experiments within the new framework). But we may still calculate specific\nsolutions with high symmetry to get an idea how the quasi-metric theory compares to\nGR. In particular, in the metric approximation we may calculate the exact counterpart\nto the Schwarzschild case of GR. That is, in Schwarzschild coordinates, for the static,\nspherically symmetric vacuum exterior to an isolated source, the field equations in the\nmetric approximation yield the (unique) solution [2]\nds\n2\n=\n(\u221a\n1 + (\nrs\n2r\n)2 \u2212\nrs\n2r\n)2(\n\u2212 (dx0)2 + [1 + (\nrs\n2r\n)2]\u22121dr2\n)\n+ r2d\u21262. (48)\nHere, d\u21262\u2261d\u03b82 + sin2\u03b8d\u03c62 and rs is the generalized Schwarzschild radius defined by\nrs\u2261\n2M (EM)GB\nc2\n+\n2MmatGS\nc2\n, M (EM)\u2261c\u22122\n\u222b \u222b \u222b\nN\u00af(T\n(EM)\n\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af\n+ T\u02c6\n(EM)i\ni )dV\u00af ,\nMmat\u2261c\u22122\n\u222b \u222b \u222b\nN\u00af(Tmat\u22a5\u00af\u22a5\u00af + T\u02c6\nmati\ni )dV\u00af . (49)\nIn equation (49), M (EM) +Mmat is the total dynamical (Komar) mass of the source and\nthe integrations are taken over the FHS. (The particular form ofM (EM) andMmat follows\ndirectly from the field equations applied to the interior of a spherically symmetric, static\nsource when extrapolated to the exterior solution given by equation (48). See reference\n[5] for details.) We notice that the metric (48) has no event horizon, but that there is a\ncurvature singularity at the origin.\nFurthermore, since bF = r\n\u2202\n\u2202r\nfor the spherically symmetric case, we easily find from\nequations (18) and (39) that\nv =\nrsc\n2r\n\u221a\n1 + ( rs\n2r\n)2\n. (50)\n24\nThen using equations (40) and (42) we get\nds2 = \u2212[1 + (\nrs\n2r\n)2]\u22122\n( rs\n2r\n+\n\u221a\n1 + (\nrs\n2r\n)2\n)\u22122\n(dx0)2\n+[1 + (\nrs\n2r\n)2]\u22121\n( rs\n2r\n+\n\u221a\n1 + (\nrs\n2r\n)2\n)2\ndr2 + r2d\u21262\n= \u2212(1 \u2212\nrs\nr\n+\n3\n8\nr3s\nr3\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7)(dx0)2 + (1 +\nrs\nr\n+\nr2s\n4r2\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7)dr2 + r2d\u21262. (51)\nWe see that this metric has no event horizon either, and that it is consistent with the\nfour \u201cclassical\u201d solar system tests. Note that this consistency is due to the existence of\nthe implicit gravitational dynamics represented by the vector field v.\nIt is important to notice that the metric (51) is only a metric approximation yielding\ncorrespondences between QMR and GR. But we may go beyond the metric approximation\nand include the effects of the non-metric part of QMR in the spherically symmetric case.\nThis is done in references [2] and [5] where it is shown that the quasi-metric theory\npredicts that the size of the solar system increases according to the Hubble law, but in\na way such that the trajectories of non-relativistic test particles are not unduly affected.\nHowever, this prediction has a number of observable consequences which are seen and in\ngood agreement with QMR [5], [6]. In particular, the prediction that the solar system\nexpands according to the Hubble law provides a natural explanation [6] of the apparently\n\u201canomalous\u201d acceleration of some distant spacecraft as inferred from radiometric data\n[7].\nWe conclude that, even if the PPN-formalism does not apply to QMR and that this\nmakes the predictions of QMR more difficult to test against experiment, some of the\nnon-metric aspects of QMR seem to agree well with observations. This represents a\nchallenge for GR and other metric theories just as much as the successes of GR represent\na challenge for any alternative theory of gravity. But it is a mathematical fact that metric\ntheories are unable to handle the non-metric aspects of QMR in a geometrical manner,\nthus making it impossible to calculate any of these effects from first principles in metric\ngravity.\n4 Quasi-metric cosmology\n4.1 General predictions\nCosmology as done in QMR is radically different from any possible approach to the\nsubject based on a metric theory of gravity. The main reason for this is, of course, that\n25\nin QMR the expansion of the Universe is not interpreted as a \u201ckinematical\u201d phenomenon\n(in a general sense of the word). Rather, by construction the cosmic expansion is a\nprior-geometric property of quasi-metric space-time itself. This means that any concept\nof the Universe as a purely gravitational dynamical system simply is not valid in QMR.\nConsequently many of the problems encountered in traditional cosmology do not exist in\nquasi-metric cosmology. For example, in QMR the expansion history of the Universe does\nnot depend on its matter density, so there is no flatness problem. Due to the coasting\nexpansion no horizon problem exists either, nor is there any need for a cosmological\nconstant. Thus QMR yields some cosmological predictions from first principles, without\nthe extra flexibility represented by the existence of a set of cosmological parameters. In\nQMR there will be cosmological problems not encountered in metric gravity, however.\nThe lack of any sort of cosmic dynamics in QMR is realized mathematically by the fact\nthat no quasi-metric counterparts to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models\nexist [2]. However, one possible cosmological model with isotropic FHSs is the toy model\ngiven by the metric family\nds2t = ds\n2\nt = \u2212(dx\n0)2 + (\nt\nt0\n)2\n( dr2\n1\u2212 r\n2\n(ct0)2\n+ r2d\u21262\n)\n= \u2212(dx0)2 + (ct)2\n(\nd\u03c72 + sin2\u03c7d\u21262\n)\n, (52)\nwhich represents an empty universe. This is a family of S3\u00d7R space-time metrics, and\nit is easy to check that it satisfies the field equations without sources and also equations\n(17), (18). Besides this empty model, it is possible to have a toy cosmological model\nwhere the Universe is filled with an isotropic null fluid. In this case one finds solutions\nconformal to the solution (52), with a conformal factor equal to N\u00af2t . Moreover, we find\nN\u00aft = exp[\u2212K\n(x0)2\n(ct)2\n] (where K is a constant depending on the fluid density) from the\nfield equations. Such solutions also satisfy equations (33), (34). But since N\u00aft is constant\non the FHSs in these models, we may transform the resulting gt into the metric family\nshown in equation (52) by setting N\u00aft = exp[\u2212K] and doing trivial re-scalings of the\ntime coordinate N\u00aftx\n0\u2192x0, the radial coordinate N\u00aftr\u2192r, and of the global time function\nN\u00aftt\u2192t. We may thus use the solution (52) in the equations of motion even for the case\nwhen the Universe is filled with a null fluid. It is also possible to find isotropic null fluid\nmodels where there is local creation of null particles. In such models N\u00aft will effectively\ndepend on t in (N , g\u00aft), and equation (34) will be violated.\nNow, one peculiar aspect of QMR is that gravitationally bound bodies made of ideal\ngas and their associated gravitational fields are predicted to expand according to the\nHubble law [2], [5]. That is, if net energy transfer between electromagnetic fields and\n26\nmaterial particles in addition to hydrostatic instabilities due to the expansion can be\nneglected (there are no such instabilities for an ideal gas), measured in atomic units,\nlinear sizes within a gravitationally bound system will increase as the scale factor, i.e.,\nproportionally to t. Note that this is valid even for the quantity c\u22122GBM\n(EM)\nt +c\n\u22122GSMmatt\n(where M\n(EM)\nt and M\nmat\nt are active masses), which has the dimension of length. On the\nother hand it is a prediction of QMR that, except for a global cosmic attenuation not\nnoticeable locally, the passive electromagnetic field is unaffected by the global cosmic\nexpansion [4]. This means that there is no reason to expect that atoms or other purely\nquantum-mechanical systems should participate in the cosmic expansion. (To clarify the\neffect of the expansion on atoms it would be necessary to perform calculations involving\nquantum fields in quasi-metric space-time.)\nA universe filled with an isotropic fluid consisting of material particles is not possible in\nQMR. That is, for any toy model universe filled with a perfect fluid source described by an\nequation of state different from \u033amc\n2 = 3p, N\u00aft must necessarily vary in space as well as in\ntime. Besides, it is not expected that these cases should yield exact solutions conformal to\nthe solution (52). However, the more relativistic the fluid, the closer its equation of state\nwill be to that of a null fluid. This means that one expects the deviations from isotropy\nto be very small in the early Universe, so that the isotropic null fluid solution should\nbe a good approximation. On the other hand, one expects increasing deviations from\nisotropy when the primeval cosmic matter cools and eventually becomes non-relativistic.\nThen said null fluid solution ceases to be a good approximate solution, and one must in\nprinciple find the solutions corresponding to the cosmic equation of state. These solutions\ncannot be isotropic. That is, one expects that gravitationally induced deviations from\nisotropy must necessarily increase with cosmic epoch in QMR, as a direct consequence\nof the transition of the cosmic matter from highly relativistic to nonrelativistic. Thus no\nfine-tuning will be necessary to get a clumpy universe from a near-isotropic beginning.\nA valid interpretation of equation (52) is that fixed operationally defined atomic\nunits vary with epoch t in such a way that atomic length units shrink when t increases.\nThis means that no matter can have been existing from the beginning of time since\natomic length units increase without bound in the limit t\u21920. Consequently, we may take\nan empty model described by equation (52) as an accurate cosmological model in this\nlimit. Thus QMR yields a natural description of the beginning of time (with no physical\nsingularity) where all big bang models fail (since big bang models are not valid for t = 0).\nBut an empty beginning of the Universe means that one needs a working matter creation\nmechanism. Thus it is natural to suggest something analogous to particle creation by\nthe expansion of the Universe in traditional big bang models. That is, in the very early\n27\nUniverse the global NKE is so strong that non-gravitational quantum fields cannot be\ntreated as localized to sufficient accuracy, so one should get spontaneous pair production\nfrom excitations of vacuum fluctuations of such quantum fields (violating equation (34)).\nMoreover, newly created material particles should induce tiny gravitational perturbations\nwhich will grow when the Universe cools. The details of these suggestions have not been\nworked out. However, any hope that QMR may represent a complete framework for\nrelativistic physics depends on if the mathematical details of a matter creation mechanism\ncan be developed.\nEven if models of the type (52) are not accurate for the present epoch, we may still\nuse it to illustrate some of the properties of a cosmological model where the expansion\nis non-kinematical. That is, the linear dependence of the scale factor on ct and the\nglobal positive curvature of space are valid predictions of any quasi-metric cosmological\nmodel, so even if a more realistic model with non-isotropic matter density does represent\na deviation from equation (52), we may still use equation (52) in combination with\nthe equations of motion to deduce some general features of quasi-metric cosmology. In\nparticular, it is easy to derive the usual expansion redshift of momentum for decoupled\nmassless particle species from equation (52). To do that, use the coordinate expression\nfor a null path in the \u03c7-direction as calculated from equation (52) and the equations of\nmotion. The result is [2]\n\u03c7(t) = \u03c7(t0) + ln\nt\nt0\n, (53)\nand a standard calculation using equation (53) yields the usual expansion redshift for-\nmula. Also the corresponding time dilation follows from equation (53).\nIn standard cosmology, the cosmic expansion affects the momentum of a photon and\nan extremely relativistic material particle the same way, meaning that the temperature\nevolution of an extremely relativistic plasma in thermal equilibrium goes as the inverse of\nthe scale factor (neglecting potential heating effects coming from net particle-antiparticle\nannihilation). On the other hand, in QMR the speed w of any inertial material point\nparticle with respect to the FOs is unaffected by the global NKE [2]. This means that\nthe plasma temperature and scale factor evolutions will be differently related from their\ncounterparts in metric theory as long as the number of material particles in thermal\nequilibrium with the cosmic photon plasma is not negligible. The effect of this on pri-\nmordial nucleosynthesis is not known. However, it seems that coasting universe models\nin metric gravity are somewhat consistent with primordial nucleosynthesis of 4He [8], but\napparently there is no natural way to match the observed abundances of deuterium and\n3He. Due to the similarity of the time scales involved, it is not likely that QMR can do\n28\nany better than said coasting models regarding primordial nucleosynthesis.\nOver the last few years a \u201cconcordance\u201d big bang model has emerged from the ob-\nservational determination of standard cosmological parameters. Key observational con-\nstraints on these cosmological parameters mainly come from two different types of data;\ni.e., from supernovae at cosmological distances (see the next section) and from analysis\nof temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The concor-\ndance model predicts that the Universe should be nearly spatially flat and filled with\nexotic matter (\u201cdark energy\u201d, possibly in the form of a cosmological constant) dominat-\ning the dynamics of the Universe, causing the cosmic expansion to accelerate. Since a\nuniverse dominated by dark energy raises some rather deep (and potentially unanswer-\nable) questions concerning its nature, it could be argued that the inferred existence of the\npreposterous dark energy might be an artefact due to analyzing observational data within\nan incorrect space-time framework. To explore this possibility the CMB data should be\nreanalyzed within the quasi-metric framework. In particular this should be done for the\ndata obtained from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). These data\nshow at least one unexpected feature; namely that the temperature angular correlation\nfunction lacks power on angular scales greater than about 60\u25e6 [9]. This may possibly have\na natural explanation within the quasi-metric framework since any quasi-metric universe\nis closed and \u201csmall\u201d; i.e., its spatial curvature scale should represent a natural cut-off\nfor fluctuations. Moreover, since no counterpart to the Friedmann equation exists in\nQMR, there are no dynamical restrictions on the data ruling out a universe with scale\nfactor close to the size of the observable Universe. This may be compared to the metric\nframework, where a closed universe cannot be too small and have a trivial topology since\nthis will be inconsistent with the value of the Hubble parameter obtained from other,\nindependent observations (see, e.g., reference [10] for a further discussion of this point).\n4.2 QMR and type Ia supernovae\nNewtonian stars for which the equation of state takes the form p\u221d\u033a\u03b3m, \u03b3 >\n6\n5\n, are called\nNewtonian polytropes [11]. In quasi-metric theory it is possible to model Newtonian\npolytropes by taking Newtonian limits of the relevant equations but such that the t-\ndependence remains. According to quasi-metric theory, the cosmic expansion is predicted\nto induce hydrostatic instabilities in polytropes consisting of degenerate matter [2], [5].\nBut if the hydrodynamical effects on the gravitational field coming from instabilities\ncan be neglected, one may solve the field equations for each epoch t assuming that\nthe polytrope is in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is then possible to show [2] that the\n29\nusual analysis of Newtonian polytropes [11] applies, but with with a variable GS, i.e.\nGS\u2192GSt\u2261\nt\nt0\nGS.\nOf particular interest are Newtonian polytropes for which \u03b3 = 4\n3\n, since such stars\nare models for Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs (WDs). From reference [11] we easily\nfind that the (passive) mass mc and physical radius Lc of such WDs (with identical\ncentral mass densities) depend on epoch such that mc(t) = (\nt0\nt\n)3/2mc(t0) and Lc(t) =\n( t0\nt\n)1/2Lc(t0), respectively. Since Chandrasekhar mass WDs are believed to be progenitors\nof type Ia supernovae, one may expect that any cosmic evolution of Chandrasekhar\nmass WDs should imply a systematic luminosity evolution of type Ia supernovae over\ncosmic time scales. However, such a luminosity evolution would be inconsistent with\ntheir use as standard candles when determining the cosmological parameters in standard\ncosmology: luminosity evolution could have serious consequences for an interpretation of\nthe supernova data in terms of an accelerating cosmic expansion indicating a non-zero\ncosmological constant [12], [13].\nNow quasi-metric theory predicts that the cosmic expansion does neither accelerate\nnor decelerate. Moreover, according to quasi-metric theory, the Chandrasekhar mass\ndecreases with epoch and this means that type Ia supernovae may be generated from\ncosmologically induced collapse of progenitor WDs. But the consequences for type Ia\nsupernova peak luminosities due to the predicted evolution of progenitor WDs are not\nclear. Since the luminosity of type Ia supernovae comes from \u03b3-disintegration of unstable\nnuclear species (mainly 56Ni) synthesized in the explosion, this luminosity could depend\ncritically on the conditions of the nuclear burn. That is, the detailed nuclear composition\nsynthesized in the explosion might depend on the local acceleration of gravity experienced\nby the burning front (which should depend on the value of GS). Other critical factors\nmight be supernova progenitor mass and chemical composition [14] (see below). Also\nthe presence of more massive ejecta during the explosion could have an influence on\nsupernova luminosities and light curves.\nThe effects of a varying gravitational \u201cconstant\u201d on type Ia supernova luminosities\nhave been studied elsewhere [15], [16]. In these papers it is assumed that the peak\nluminosity is proportional to the synthesized mass of 56Ni which again is assumed to be\nproportional to the Chandrasekhar mass. Moreover, using a toy model of the supernova\nexplosion, the dependence of the intrinsic time scale \u03c4s of the explosion on G\nS has been\ndeduced (neglecting radioactive heating). The results are\nL(t)\u221d\n( GS(t)\nGS(t0)\n)\u2212 3\n2\n, \u03c4s(t)\u221d\n( GS(t)\nGS(t0)\n)\u2212 3\n4\n. (54)\nWe see that if both of these luminosity and intrinsic time scale evolutions were valid within\n30\nthe quasi-metric framework, we would have been forced to deduce that L(z)\u221d(1 + z)\n3\n2\nand \u03c4s(z)\u221d(1 + z)\n3\n4 . This means that, rather than intrinsically fainter, ancient super-\nnovae would have been predicted to be intrinsically brighter than today\u2019s in addition to\ndisplaying broader light curves, contrary to observations. But it is by no means obvious\nthat the toy model yielding the above luminosity and intrinsic time scale evolutions is\nsufficiently realistic. Rather one should include all aspects of progenitor evolution on\ntype Ia supernovae before deducing such evolutions. In particular, the amount of 56Ni\nsynthesized in the explosion and thus the supernova luminosity will depend on the C/O\nratio present in the progenitor WD. In general, more massive progenitor WDs will have\nsmaller C/O ratios than less massive ones due to different conditions in the He-burning\nstages of their progenitor stars [17]. A smaller C/O ratio implies that a smaller per-\ncentage of 56Ni should be produced relative to other explosion products [17]. Besides, a\nsmaller C/O ratio will affect the energetics of the explosion such that ejecta velocities and\nthus supernova size will be smaller at any given time after the explosion [17]. Since these\neffects may be important for supernova luminosity evolution, it is possible that ancient\nsupernovae in fact could be intrinsically dimmer than today\u2019s, despite their being more\nmassive. But any investigation of this possibility requires detailed numerical simulations,\nso before such have been performed it is not possible to say whether or not the predictions\nfrom quasi-metric theory are consistent with the data.\nHowever, what we can easily do is to see if it is possible to construct a simple lumi-\nnosity evolution which, in combination with the cosmological toy model (52), yields a\nreasonable fit to the supernova data. That is, we may try a luminosity evolution of the\nsource of the form\nLqmr = Lstd(\nt0\nt\n)\u01eb = Lstd(1 + z)\n\u2212\u01eb, (55)\nwhere Lstd is a fixed standard luminosity, and see if the data are well fitted for some\nvalue(s) of \u01eb. To check this, we use the postulated luminosity evolution to plot apparent\nmagnitude mqmr versus redshift for type Ia supernovae. The easiest way to compare this\nto data, is to calculate the predicted difference between the quasi-metric model (with\nsource luminosity evolution) and a FRW model where the scale factor increases linearly\nwith epoch, namely the \u201cexpanding Minkowski universe\u201d given by a piece of Minkowski\nspace-time:\nds2 = \u2212(dx0)2 + (x0)2\n(\nd\u03c72 + sinh2\u03c7d\u21262\n)\n. (56)\nThe difference in apparent magnitude \u2206m between the two models (as a function of\n31\nredshift z) can be found by a standard calculation. The result is\n\u2206m\u2261mqmr \u2212mmin = 2.5log10\n[\nsin2{ln(1 + z)}\n]\n\u22125log10\n[\nsinh{ln(1 + z)}\n]\n\u2212 2.5log10\nLqmr\nLmin\n, (57)\nwhere Lqmr/Lmin represents the luminosity evolution of the source in our quasi-metric\nmodel relative to no luminosity evolution in an empty FRW model. One may then find\nthe relation mqmr(z) from equation (57) and the relation mmin(z) graphically shown in\nreference [12], and then compare to data. One finds that the quasi-metric model is quite\nconsistent with the data for values of \u01eb of about 0.5. That is, for \u01eb near 0.5, \u2206m has a\nmaximum at z\u22480.5; for higher redshifts \u2206m decreases (and eventually becomes negative\nfor z larger than about 1.2). In standard cosmology this behaviour would be interpreted\nas evidence for an era of cosmic deceleration at high z.\nWe conclude that quasi-metric cosmology combined with a simple luminosity evolution\nseems to be consistent with the data but that a much more detailed model should be\nconstructed to see if the postulated luminosity evolution has some basis in the physics of\ntype Ia supernovae.\nFrom the above we see that the assertion that type Ia supernovae can be used as stan-\ndard cosmic candles independent of cosmic evolution is a model-dependent assumption.\nBut the fact is that models for which this holds fail to explain the effects of the cosmic\nexpansion seen in the solar system [5], [6]. Thus, any interpretation of the supernova\ndata indicating that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating should be met with\nsome extra skepticism.\n5 Conclusions\nIn many ways any theory of gravity compatible with the quasi-metric framework must\nbe fundamentally different from metric theories of gravity since quasi-metric space-time\nis not modeled as a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. The most obvious of these differences\nis the existence of a non-metric sector and the fact that it directly influences the equa-\ntions of motion. This means that the existence of a non-metric sector may be inferred\nfrom data on test particle motion. In fact, non-metric effects on test particle motion in\nweak gravitational fields can be tested against experiment rather independently of any\nsystematic weak field expansion for the metric sector. And the status so far is that it\nseems like non-metric effects are seen in good agreement with predictions [5], [6].\n32\nThe geometrical structure of quasi-metric space-time also gives QMR some conceptual\nadvantages over metric theory. For example, the simple causal structure of QMR leaves\nno room for event horizons. Thus potential vexing questions concerning the nature of\nblack holes and space-time singularities do not exist in QMR. Besides, quasi-metric space-\ntime is constructed to yield maximal predictive power. This shows up most clearly in\ncosmology, since both the predicted global shape and curvature of the Universe in addition\nto its expansion history are basic features of QMR and not adjustable. This is in contrast\nto metric theory, where essentially arbitrary cosmic initial conditions and a number of\ncosmological parameters are available, making it much more flexible than QMR. Should\nQMR turn out to survive confrontation with cosmological observations, the vulnerability\nof QMR predictions would give strong support to QMR.\nBut quasi-metric gravity, even in its metric sector, is different from those metric\ntheories suitable for a standard PPN-analysis. The main reason for this, is the existence of\na dynamical, distinguished foliation of quasi-metric space-time into spatial hypersurfaces,\nand that the existence of this foliation is directly implemented into the form of the\nfield equations. Besides, quasi-metric gravity also contains a (not independent) implicit\ndynamical gravitational vector field family vt not coupled explicitly to matter. Neither of\nthese features has any correspondence with the standard PPN-framework. Unfortunately,\nthe lack of a weak field expansion formalism (having some necessary correspondence with\nthe PPN-framework) makes it harder to test the metric aspects of QMR. However, a\nweak field expansion scheme is not needed to see that the geometric structure of quasi-\nmetric space-time is consistent with no Nordtvedt effect. In other words, the quasi-metric\ntheory of gravity presented in this paper should fulfil the Gravitational Weak Equivalence\nPrinciple (GWEP). In fact, many experiments testing the validity of the SEP actually\ntest the GWEP. Thus the fact that QMR violates the SEP needs not be fatal.\nBut there are other crucial observational tests which QMR has to survive. For exam-\nple, the detailed spectrum of temperature fluctuations in the CMB must be consistent\nwith predictions coming from QMR. Another task is to construct a model of primor-\ndial nucleosynthesis in QMR. Predictions coming from such a model must be at least be\nconsistent with the observed abundance of 4He. For abundances of other light nuclear\nspecies, e.g., deuterium and 3He, there must be found some other natural explanations\nif the predicted primordial abundances do not match observations. So there is much\nfurther work to be done before we can know whether or not QMR is viable. However,\nobservations do seem to confirm the existence of a non-metric sector. This suggests that\nmetric theory is wrong so QMR sails up as a potential alternative.\n33\nAcknowledgment\nI wish to thank Dr. K\u02daare Olaussen for making a critical review of the manuscript.\nReferences\n[1] C.M.

A pre- and \npost-test quasi-experimental design was employed using two intact classes of civil \nengineering students from Malaysian polytechnics. The treatment group (n = 29) \nmanipulated objects and learnt to sketch from observation and imagination \nduring their structural design class, while the control group, (n = 28) had their \nregular structural design class. The treatment group achieved a statistically \nsignificant gain in spatial visualisation ability compared to the control group. A \nstatistically significant difference was neither found between gender irrespective \nof types of instruction nor for the interaction effect. It was concluded that the \nspatial activities enhances students' spatial visualisation ability and both male \nandfemale engineering students benefited equally from the intervention. \nTeaching and learning, spatial activities, structural design, \nspatial visualisation ability, civil engineering \nINTRODUCTION \nSpatial visualisation ability is a subset of spatial ability - one of the factors of human \nintelligence structure. Spatial visualisation ability has been defined as, \" the ability to \nmentally manipulate, rotate, twist, or invert pictorially presented stimulus objects.\" (McGee, \n1979, p. 893). This multi-faceted ability helps engineers including civil engineers to \nconceptualise links between reality and the abstract model of that reality. For example, in the \nanalysis of a loaded beam structure, the deflected shape of the beam is the reality and the \nmathematical equation chosen (often unseen in a computer design package) to represent this \ndeflected shape is the abstract model of that reality. A civil engineer needs first to have an \nintuitive understanding of the interactive relationships among structural components before he \ncould begin to predict the deflected shape, which leads to the identification of the abstract \nmodel. This intuitive understanding is also essential to civil engineers in another way. It helps \nthem in visualising, predicting, designing and checking for the worst possible combination of \nloads on a given structure. In the design of a reinforced concrete design for example, the \nability to visualise aids the engineer in the prediction of critical loading conditions, which is \nnecessary in reaching an adequate reinforcement design. \nSpatial visualisation ability has also been found to be essential to a student's success in some \nengineering related subjects such as calculus (Winkle, 1997), mathematics, (Battista, \n2 Effects of Instructions on Spatial Visualisation Ability in Civil Engineering Students \nWheatley and Talsma, 1989), engineering drawing (Sorby and Baartmans, 1996a) and \ncomputer-aided design (Sorby, 1999). Early indication for a positive relationship between this \nability and structural design has also been found. Alias (2000) carried out a learning task \nanalysis on the design of a reinforced concrete column - an area that demands a wide variety \nof structural design skills - and discovered that spatial skills are pre-requisite to the learning of \ncolumn design suggesting that spatial visualisation ability may be essential to the success of \nstructural design. \nOverall, spatial visualisation ability may be critical to learning and problem solving in civil \nengineering especially to the learning of subject matter that demands spatial strategies such as \nstructural design, engineering mathematics and soil mechanics. There has also been some \nsuggestions that spatial ability is relevant to problem solving that is not dependent on spatial \nstrategies proposed by Roberts, Gilmore and Wood (1997). Roberts, et al. proposed that in \ncases where non-spatial strategies are required, spatial ability influences the degree to which a \nproblem solver is able to develop and evaluate these strategies. \nIn summary, spatial visualisation ability appears to be necessary to problem solving in \nengineering related areas that requires spatial as well as non-spatial strategies. Therefore, a \nbetter understanding of this ability should be potentially beneficial to the engineering \neducation and profession. \nFACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO DIFFERENCES IN SPATIAL \nVISUALISATION ABILITY \nDifferences in spatial visualisation ability and its acquisition have been attributed to a number \nof variables, including cognitive development, spatial experiences, gender and aptitude. \nCognitive development \nAccording to Piaget and Inhelder (1971), a person's cognitive development determines the \npotential of what he/she could achieve. Four stages of cognitive development have been \nsuggested, that is, (i) the sensori-motor stage, (ii) the pre-operational stage, (iii) the concrete \noperational stage, and (iv) the formal operational stage. A person who is at the concrete \noperational stage \" always starts with experience and makes limited interpolations and \nextrapolations from the data available to his senses\" (Piaget in Phillips, 1969, p. 104). On the \nother hand, a person at the formal operational stage does not need to experience in order to \ngenerate and evaluate propositions. As such, a formal operational thinker can be expected to \nmake use of a variety of spatial possibilities and to have better spatial skills compared to those \nwho have yet to reach this stage. According to Piaget and Inhelder (1971), children start to \ndevelop their formal operational skills at the age of 13; reaching their maximum potential by \nthe age of 17, suggesting that students in post secondary education are formal operational \nthinkers. However, later studies have shown a high percentage of post-secondary students who \nhave yet to reach the formal operational stage (Killian, 1979; Reesink, 1985). This has \nsignificant implications for teaching even in higher education, since reaching the formal \noperational stage is a result of a combination of maturation and experience. While maturation \nmay come with age, experience is most likely to be the consequence of education. \nExperiences \nSpatial experiences - acquired through life experiences or formal education - have been \nsuggested to contribute to differences in spatial visualisation ability. Deno (1995) finds that \nspatial experiences in non-academic subjects are correlated to spatial visualisation ability in \nengineering students. He also finds indications of differential effects of spatial experiences on \nAlias, Black and Gray 3 \ngender. For example, playing with construction block type of toys is found to be a good \npredictor of male ability while activities that are visual and less tactile are good predictors for \nfemales. This has implications for children growing up in non-technological societies who \nlack play experiences and toys common in more developed countries. \nBen-Chaim, Lappan and Houang (1988) find that spatial activities that require the subjects to \nconstruct, evaluate and sketch models of buildings created from cubes could enhance spatial \nvisualisation ability. Lord (1985) also observes an increase in spatial visualisation ability in \nhis subjects of college students after undergoing planes through solids type of interventions. \nSo did Seddon, Eniaiyeju and Jusoh (1984) who find that his group of 19 to 30 year old \nsubjects benefits from instructions on orthographic projections. \nSince spatial visualisation ability is a multifaceted ability, any attempt to improve the ability \nmay influence the acquisition of one aspect of it while not the others as demonstrated by \nZavotka (1987). Zavotka finds that while her students improve on their orthographic \nprojection skills after following a program on computer animated graphics, they however, do \nnot improve on their mental rotation skills. She finds that the students' performance on the \nmental rotation measure is significantly affected by the sequence of the films that are shown \nto them, that is, wire-frame to solid or vice versa. Interestingly, Braukmann and Pedras (1993) \nfind that different spatial activities do not necessarily bring about a difference in performance \non spatial ability. They find that using traditional drafting equipment is as effective as a using \ncomputer aided design in enhancing spatial skills in engineering students. \nIt appears that providing diverse spatial activities may be the key to enhancing overall spatial \nvisualisation ability as illustrated by Sorby and Baartmans (1996a). Sorby and Baartmans \nprescribed diverse spatial activities to their engineering students, ranging from manipulation \nof concrete models to computer visualisation activities, and find that they improve greatly in \ntheir spatial visualisation ability as measured by The Purdue Spatial Visualisation Test. \nIn conclusion, the findings from previous studies support the hypothesis that spatial \nvisualisation ability is affected by spatial experiences and the effect could be on overall or \nsome aspects of the ability depending on the types of experiences. The impact of different \ntypes of spatial activities on spatial ability was taken into account in the design of teaching \nand learning activities for this study. \nGender \nFindings from past studies indicate possible relationship between spatial visualisation ability \nand gender. For example, Vandenberg and Kuse (1978) and Hamilton (1995) find that males' \nperform better than females' on spatial mental rotation tasks, an indicator of spatial \nvisualisation ability. Ben-Chaim, et al., (1988) also find that prior to instruction, boys in \nmiddle school were better in their spatial visualisation ability compared to girls although these \ndifferences disappeared after instruction on spatial skills. \nHowever, some research findings are showing evidence for superior performance by certain \ngroups of females. For example, Eisenberg and McGinty (1977) find that groups of female \nuniversity students who enrolled in two types of mathematics program (i) calculus, and (ii) \nbusiness statistics, performed better on the spatial visualisation measure compared to their \nmale counterparts. The performances of the groups enrolled in the (iii) remedial mathematics, \nand (iv) mathematics for elementary school teachers program were however reversed. \nAs there is no clear relationship between gender and spatial visualisation ability, gender was \nconsidered as a potential source of confounding in the study. \n4 Effects of Instructions on Spatial Visualisation Ability in Civil Engineering Students \nAptitude \nStudies have also indicated some form of relationship between aptitude (general intelligence) \nand spatial visualisation ability. Aptitude has been shown to affect choice of strategy \n(Kyllonen, Lohman and Snow, 1984) and choice of strategy has been shown to affect \nperformance on spatial tests, as indicators of spatial ability (Schultz, 1991). In brief, aptitude \nis related to spatial visualisation ability. Therefore, aptitude was also treated as a source of \nconfounding in the study that needed to be controlled. \nMETHODOLOGY \nResearch questions and statistical hypotheses \nThree research questions were investigated. \n1. Could spatial visualisation ability of civil engineering students be improved through \nspatial activities consisting primarily of object manipulations and free hand sketching? \n2. Is there a difference in spatial visualisation ability between males and females engineering \nstudents? \n3. Do these spatial activities affect males and female students differently? \nThe three null-hypotheses were: \na) there will be no statistically significant difference between the experimental and control \ngroup in their mean gain scores on the Spatial Visualisation Ability measure irrespective \nof gender; \nb) there will be no statistically significant difference between males and females in their \nspatial visualisation ability mean gain scores as measured by the Spatial Visualisation \nAbility measure irrespective of treatments; and \nc) there will be no statistically significant interactions between gender and treatments. \nResearch variables \nThe dependent variable was the gain score on the test instrument that is, the difference \nbetween the post-test score and the pre-test score. The independent variables were gender \n(male and female) and types of learning program (prescribed specific spatial activities and not \nprescribed). \nResearch design and procedure \nA quasi-experimental design method, as intact classes, were used, with pre and post-tests, \nwith one group as a control was adopted for the study. Pre-tests on spatial visualisation ability \nwere administered to both groups following which, the experimental group carried out some \nspatial activities as part of their structural design class over a period of one week. At the same \ntime, the control group followed their normal structural design class. At the end of the week, \nspatial visualisation ability post-tests were administered to both groups. The short interval \nbetween the pre- and post-test was an advantage as it removed maturation effects from being a \nsource of confounding. \nAlias, Black and Gray 5 \nResearch Population \nThe population for the study was the civil engineering diploma students in Malaysian \npolytechnics. Malaysian polytechnics are post-secondary institutions, which train technical \npersonnel in the three major areas of engineering, civil, mechanical and electrical engineering. \nThese polytechnics offer 2-year certificate and 3-year diploma programs to secondary school \nleavers (age 16+). Diploma recipients of polytechnic engineering programs may either seek \nemployment as assistants to engineers or further their studies to become engineers themselves. \nFor this reason, the polytechnic diploma program is designed to be the equivalent of the first-\nyear degree program in Malaysian universities to enable the graduates not only to seek \nemployment but also to further their studies in engineering. \nAlthough no spatial ability studies have been carried out on polytechnic students prior to this \nstudy, they were expected to have some spatial visualisation skills, which they acquired \nthrough the drafting courses taken in their earlier semesters. The engineering drafting course \nhowever, was designed primarily to develop draughtsmanship skills (Malaysian Ministry of \nEducation, 1991) in these engineering students. \nIn this study, we aimed to discover whether a few hours of spatial activities involving object \nmanipulations and free hand sketching could further improve spatial visualisation ability of \nthese civil engineering students. \nResearch Sample \nThe experimental group was a class of civil engineering diploma students from Ungku Omar \npolytechnic while the control was the corresponding class from Port Dickson polytechnic. The \naverage age of the experimental and control groups were 21.7 years and 21.5 years \nrespectively. The proportions of males and females in both groups were similar and consistent \nwith the ratio for all civil engineering students. \nAs shown by previous studies (Killian, 1979) secondary school leavers could still be pre-\noperational thinkers. Therefore, it was logical to assume that the samples were a combination \nof formal operations and concrete operations (or transitional thinkers. Nevertheless, a \nproportion of the non-formal to formal operations thinkers was expected to be comparable in \nboth groups. This was a consequence of the random placement procedure of students into \npolytechnics practised by the Ministry of Education. Consequently, non-comparable groups \nwith respect to formal or non-formal operations thinkers were not anticipated to be a source of \nconfounding. \nTeaching and learning materials \nThe learning activities prescribed for the study were designed with Piaget's learning theory in \nmind, that is, a person learns progressively from the concrete to the abstract. Although the \nmajor application of Piaget's theory of learning and stage theory was to children, it is also \nequally applicable to adults (Sutherland, 1999). \nThe purpose of these activities was to develop generic spatial visualisation skills as well as \nstructural engineering specific skills. Initially, subjects used building blocks as aids to \nvisualisation. Subjects also sketched objects (constructed from blocks) from observation and \nimagination. The generic activities were adapted from Izard (1990), Baartmans and Sorby \n(1996), Sorby and Baartmaan (1996b) and Lappan, Phillips and Winter (1984). The structural \nengineering specific activities consisted of manipulations of beam models, which were \ndeveloped after a consultation with a civil engineering lecturer (C. Howard, personal \ncommunication, April, 1998) and sketching of structural diagrams, which were derived from \n6 \nBrohn (1990). The overall emphasis was on concrete activities, which have been shown to \nbenefit both formal operational and pre-operational thinkers. \nInstrumentation \nThe spatial visualisation ability instrument was specifically designed for the study. To give a \ncomprehensive measure of spatial visualisation ability, the instrument employed three types of \nspatial tasks: cube construction tasks, engineering drawing and mental rotation tasks. For each \ntest item, subjects were instructed to choose one from four alternatives. Examples of the items \nare illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3. The instrument consisted of 28 items, 10 on the first task \n(Section I), 11 on the second task (Section II) and seven on the third task (Section III). The \ninstrument had a Kuder-Richardson 20 (KR20) coefficient of 0.70 and a concurrent validity of \n0.74 with the Vandenberg Mental Rotation Test (Vandenberg, 1971). The KR20 coefficients \nfor Sections I, II and III were 0.55, 0.43 and 0.53 respectively. The validity of these tasks as \nmeasures of spatial visualisation ability has been established in other studies. \nf \na \nK & \nt\u00a3b \nnM Ep \nO O O O \nFigure 1.

The difference between gender means irrespective of treatments is \nalso relatively large indicating a possibility for a statistically significant difference between \nmeans for genders. \nTable 4: Means x , standard deviations s, on the engineering \ndrawing items and sample sizes n \nControl Experimenta \n1 \nGender main effect \nx = 0.50 2.00 1.25 \nFemale s = 1.41 2.49 2.19 \nnf = 8 11 19 \nx = 1.50 2.83 2.17 \nMale s = 2.35 2.01 2.27 \nnm = 20 18 38 \nx = 1.21 2.52 1.71 \nTreatment \nmain effect s = 2.15 2.20 2.25 \nn = 28 29 57 \nAs expected, a statistically significant result was found for the treatment main effect as shown \nin Table 5 with a statistical power of 0.55. Surprisingly, statistical significance was not found \nfor the gender main effect or the interaction effect. \nAlias, Black and Gray 9 \nFinally, no statistical significance was found on the mental rotation items for all the \nhypotheses tested. \nTable 5: A two way ANOVA on the gain scores for the engineering \ndrawing items using worksheet in Excel from Black (1999) \nSS df MSfsfest) F f*critical a Outcome \nGender 10.46 1 10.46 2.36 4.02 0.05 n.s \nTreatment 21.12 1.00 21.12 4.76 4.02 0.05 p<0.05 \nInteraction 1.48 1 1.48 0.33 4.02 0.05 n.s \nWithin 235.26 53 4.44 \nTotal 268.32 56 \nDISCUSSION \nThe positive effects of teaching and learning on spatial visualisation ability found in this study \nare consistent with those from previous studies where similar teaching interactions had been \nused (Lord, 1985; Ben-Chaim, et al., 1988; Tillotson, 1984; Seddon, et al., 1984; Sorby and \nBaartmans, 1996a). \nThe absence of gender related differences in this study is however, in contradiction with \nprevious research findings, which show poorer performance of females compared to males on \nspatial visualisation ability tasks (Ben-Chaim, et al., 1988; Eisenberg and McGinty, 1977; \nAllen and Hogeland, 1978). One possible explanation is that the types of spatial tasks \nemployed in the present study were not the ones that tend to elicit gender differences. Most \nreported findings on gender differences are on the mental rotation tasks (Hamilton, 1995; \nVandenberg, 1978) while findings on other types of spatial tasks are inconsistent. Alyman and \nPeters (1993) for example, find that out of nine spatial tasks - tasks involving everyday \nobjects and settings - males only perform better on two, one of which is a mental rotation task \nand the effect size was less than 0.100. Therefore, even if females are weak in executing \nmental rotation of whole objects, they may be good in executing other spatial visualisation \nprocesses. The spatial visualisation ability instrument, which consisted of three types of \nspatial tasks, may have provided the female subjects with the opportunity to demonstrate the \nfull spectrum of their spatial visualisation skills and thus performed equally well as the male \nsubjects. \nAnother possible explanation is similarity in the types of spatial experiences of females and \nmales in the study. Since females in this study were students who chose to study civil \nengineering - a male dominated field - it is likely for them to have some shared \ncharacteristics, such as shared spatial experiences. For example, similar spatial experiences \nearly in life between males and females in this study, which leads to equivalent level of spatial \nability, may have dictated their courses preference, which might explain the absence of \ngender-related differences in spatial visualisation ability of the samples. Furthermore, the \nfemales in the present study had had similar skills training (reading and interpreting \nengineering drawings as their male counterparts, in contrast to the females in the previously \ncited studies. This training might have wiped out or reduced considerably the initial difference \nin spatial skills if it existed. In brief, most probably there is no difference in spatial \nvisualisation ability between males and females engineering students in the study. \nOn the individual components of the ability instrument, statistical significance was only found \nfor the treatment main effect on the engineering drawing items. This is not surprising, as the \n10 Effects of Instructions on Spatial Visualisation Ability in Civil Engineering Students \nsubjects were familiar with engineering drawing. Therefore, the prescribed spatial activities \nmay have facilitated the development of the most appropriate spatial strategies leading to \nbetter performance on the given tasks. \nLack of treatment effect on the cube construction items was, however, contrary to \nexpectations. Nevertheless, the reliability of this particular instrument is only 0.55, so the \nfinding must be treated with caution. \nSimilarly, lack of statistical significance in any of the hypotheses tested for the mental rotation \nitems was also unexpected. Several factors could have contributed to this outcome. First, there \nwas lack of shared characteristics between the teaching and learning materials and the test \nitems. The learning materials consisted of relatively simple objects (constructed from building \ncubes) with square and non-slanting surfaces, while the test items were representations of \ncomplex objects, some with slanting and non-rectangular surfaces. Reported gains in mental \nrotation skills are mostly acquired through transfer tasks that were very similar to the practice \ntasks (Seddon and Shubber, 1985; Shubbar, 1990). \nSecondly, implicit teaching of mental rotation skills, a component of spatial visualisation \nability, could also be the cause for the lack of gain in mental rotation. For example, although it \nwas expected that the subjects should be able to predict changes in the perspective view upon \nrotation of an object, subjects were not instructed to observe these changes during training. \nFor example, during the sketching exercise, they were not asked to draw views of objects \nother than those seen from the standard views. \nThirdly, lack of gain could also be due to lack of mastery of depth cues. According to Seddon \nand Eniaiyeju (1986), the ability to visualise the effects of rotation transformations on \ndiagrams of 3-dimensional structures is dependent on mastery of depth cues, which are the \nrelative size cue, overlap cue, foreshortened line cue and the distortion of angles cue. Depth \ncues were however, not taught in the study and only three depth cues, that is, the distortion of \nangle cue, the overlap cue and the foreshortened line cue were used for the test items. The \nrelative size cue was not provided, as that would be inconsistent with the engineering drawing \nconvention. \nLastly, the low instrument reliability must also be considered, as the reliability of this \nparticular component of the spatial ability instrument is only 0.53. \nLIMITATIONS \nThe study is a field study that attempted to investigate the inter-relationships between learning \nand psychological variables in an engineering educational setting and was the first of its kind \nin Malaysia (Education Planning and Research Division, 1999). Naturally, it was a complex \nand challenging piece of research to cany out and it was no great surprise to us that the \nlimitations only became apparent as the research progressed. For example, the sample sizes \nwere less than ideal for the factorial design method adopted for the data analysis. The impact \nof the small samples was made worse by the unequal sample sizes between the male and \nfemale samples. However, the unequal sample sizes were unavoidable as the study employed \nintact classes of students where the smaller proportion of females to males is typical in any \ncivil engineering population. \nThe short duration provided for training on spatial skills was also less than ideal. It is \nexpected that longer teaching and learning duration could resolve the questions on gender by \nenhancing the prospect of greater effect size. \nAlias, Black and Gray 11 \nCONCLUSION \nThis study set out to establish causal relationships between teaching and learning of spatial \nskills and spatial visualisation ability. Although the improvement in the components of the \nspatial visualisation ability was varied, with the largest gain being on the engineering drawing \ntasks and the least on the mental rotation tasks the study did show that spatial visualisation \nskills in general were improved after the teaching and learning activities. The finding was \ndeemed educationally significant although the gain in skills for the experimental group was \nnot large that is, 1.6 marks (5.8%) higher than the control group. This gain highlights the role \nof concrete spatial activities in the development of spatial visualisation ability in engineering \nstudents. May be, more concrete activities should be provided to engineering students to give \nthem the basis for imagination, as what one does not see or experience one cannot imagine. \nMore importantly, if spatial visualisation ability is accepted as being important to problem \nsolving and learning in engineering, engineering educators need to place more emphasis on \nthe development of these skills in their engineering students. For example, spatial skills \ntraining should be integrated across the curriculum, which would increase students' awareness \nof its importance thus optimising the conditions for positive skills transfer. Remedial lessons \nshould also be made available to those who have poor spatial visualisation ability as normally \npractised with those who are weak in the mathematical and analytical skills. \nREFERENCE \nAlias, M.

Computing courses in Malaysian \ntertiary institutions of higher learning take mathematics as the core subject where tutorials are \nsometimes spent as remedial. However, there are research being done using technology and \ncollaborative learning with mixed results (Mohd Sazali et.al, 2010a; Mays, 2005).  According \nto a Tracer Study Polytechnic MOHE Malaysia in 2006, IT graduates were employed mainly \nin services industries where decision makings has to be made fast in the Kuala Lumpur stock \nexchange for example, was the most valuable asset sought for by prospective employers. To \ndevelop this a curriculum of mathematics in I.T. era was designed. Anecdotally, in year 2000 \nFTMM (Fakulti Teknologi Maklumat dan Multimedia) was operating as a department called \n 4th International Conference on Science and Mathematics Education 2011  \n2 \n \nJTMM under Faculty Engineering Technology, in KUiTTHO (Kolej Universiti Teknologi \nTun Hussein Onn).  As a result Diploma Mathematics IT 1 adopted UTM\u201fs Diploma \nComputer Science syllabus and curriculum.  Discrete Mathematics topics and tutorial (pen \nand paper) was the order since most of the mathematics lecturers graduated from UTM.  In \n2004 KUiTTHO was officially upgraded into the 17th full fledged public university in \nMalaysia called UTHM and JTMM became a faculty called FTMM which introduced \nMathematics IT 1 and Mathematics IT 2 for the first year diploma students with all the \nmathematics topics still intact plus the introduction of  laboratory activities (Mohd Sazali et \nal, 2006). The objective was to let the students see mathematics applications in information \ntechnology.  License packages like SPSS and Matlab were incorporated into the syllabus \nsince it took more rigorous statistical approach with probability distributions, permutations \nand hypothesis testing.  Problem Based Learning (PBL) was tried in UTHM using Republic \nPolytechnic Singapore experience as the yardstick.  This paper has five sections. Current \nissues, methodology, research procedure, results and discussions. \n \nCurrent Issues \nAt diploma level many lecturers from the local universities found that mathematics \nwas not rigorously understood   even though the students who successfully entered the \nuniversity programs with high grade score in SPM (equivalent to GCSE \u201eO\u201f levels).  For \nexample statistics from Kelantan State Education Department (2003 \u2013 2006) revealed the \naverage rate of passes SPM Mathematics was 75% only.  This means that 25% failed \nmathematics at SPM level.  In spite of 75% passes, some of them were found to be struggling \nin mathematics, statistics and quantitative methods once they entered Diploma and degree \nstudies especially on topics involving algebra (Mohd Salleh, 1990).  Something must be done \nsome how quickly since e-learning has become the in-things of today. More over algebra is \nthe gate to many advance mathematical topics in the universities. \nMany researches were done about the above problem with mixed results (Healy, \n1998; Heid, 2002 and Zain et al 2006).   In Malaysia, many young teachers complained that \nthey could not deliver mathematics concepts very well in English which started 2003 during \nPPSMI. (Tan, 2007).   PPSMI was introduced at Primary Year 1, Form 1 and Lower 6 at the \npublic schools.  It was found that many senior teachers who were trained in English medium \nschools took administrative duties  while the young teachers (aged 45 below) who had learnt \nand fully trained in  mathematics in Malaysian language beginning 1979.  Razali Hassan \n(2008) studied on learners and teachers style using computers. He correctly pinpointed one \nthing - both parties have different strength and weaknesses as far as learning and teaching \nstyles which did not match for the optimum benefit for the students\u201f side. \nDuring PPSMI, in order to hasten many ideas, the Ministry introduced critical \nallowance schemes, computer notebooks for mathematics and science teachers and many \nkind of ICT courses were offered during the school holidays.  At the earlier stages when this \nscheme was introduced many teachers were happy.  But soon many reports came where \ncomputers were stolen from schools and some teachers misused the computers.  Besides, \nmany parents perceived that tuition in mathematics was more effective than schools.  This is \nbecause young teachers are inexperienced (Marzita Puteh, 2003).  Currently, all teachers are \npaying so much attention to examination results.  The whole country was so obsessed with  \nhow many \u201eAs\u201f each school and candidate can get every time the examination result was \nannounced .   From this result  the school is categorized into cluster schools and  these school  \nare going to be treated differently  from the ministry in terms of  annual \u201ebudget\u201f, staff \n 4th International Conference on Science and Mathematics Education 2011  \n3 \n \nrecruitment  and other incentives.  One of them is they can hire their own set of teachers \n(PTA Talk in KISAS) and the school enjoyed better treatment.  Unknowingly, sometimes \ncreative teachers are temporarily sidelined. A creative teacher is defined as someone who is \nbraved enough to teach differently from the syllabus (Schifter and Fosnot , 1993).  Once the \nschool is very focused to excel only in the public examination it was found the standard of \nquestions posed by the teachers were steroetyped. What is asked are mostly public \nexamination questions and nothing else.  Without critical and challenging questions it is hard \nto produce holistic learning that produce first class engineers, scientists and professionals \n(Noraini Idris, 2006).  Noraini claimed that students taught mathematics in visual mode \nunderstood mathematics better.  But Healy (1998) disagreed when many visual aided students \nunderstood mathematics from the surface level only and this was insufficient for higher \ncollege mathematics. \nOne of the main features of cluster and smart schools is the employment of ICT in \nteaching mathematics and sciences. Advantages of computer-aided-instruction are increased \nstudent engagement and motivation, providing students with a greater level of individualized \ninstruction (Barrow et al., 2008).  Since mathematics is synonym to drilling and practice, ICT \nis looked as the rescue to teaching problems especially in remedial work. According to MOE \nINTEL 2007 report, USA experienced 20 \u2013 30 percent remedial classes at high colleges and \nfirst year degree programs.  When Malaysia is facing with remedial classes in polytechnics \nand colleges communities MOHE, it seems that USA, a developed country, is experiencing \nthat too (Barrow et al, 2008). \nDrilling and practicing is taken quite well at schools because item analysis by Chai \nMun and Tiong (2005) found that 50% of the PMR and UPSR questions set 2003 \u2013 2006 was \ncategorically put as simple,  30% are medium difficulty and 20% are challenging.  Many \n\u201enaughty\u201f teachers know that by drilling their students at easy and middle type of questions \nthis would suffice their students to pass in any public exam. As a result many students are not \nexposed at all to harder critical thinking skills since many teachers rushed with the syllabus.  \nOnce they are at the university the students look so lost.  They cannot help themselves with \ninternet to find important facts regarding mathematics learning.  What was seen they used \nICT not for studying related subjects. \nUnderstanding the above issue FTMM was braved to introduce Mathematics IT \nsyllabus for two semesters in Diploma Information Technology (DIT) Year 1.  Assessment of \nthis subject is 60: 40 favouring coursework than final examination.  This style of evaluation \nand assessment is identical to polytechnic education assessment system in this country since \nthe students in DIT programs were graduates from the polytechnics and college community \nMOHE.   Smart school came with ICT technology.  Zain et al (2006) complained that not all \nschool heads know how to instruct the teachers in using CD-ROMS supplied by Technology \nEducation Department, MOE. These so called principals always focus on exam results while \nCD-ROM put forward many ideas that can come later.  So it seems there is lacking in using \nteaching aids like CD at schools.  MOE Project Report (2007) suggested the schools to \nintroduce ICT into mathematics and science subjects beginning primary and secondary \nschools in order to create talented pool of engineers, scientists and entrepreneurs but they \nhave some problems including time tabling in schools and getting smoother accessibility \ntowards teachers in running ICT courses during school holidays.  They suggested group \nblocking on certain specific day from the time table in order to reduce technical problem  \ncarrying ICT tools into classrooms.  But the success of smart schools depends   heavily on \nteachers\u201f attitude.  Attitude, motivation are all related in working successfully among teams \n 4th International Conference on Science and Mathematics Education 2011  \n4 \n \nin society (Shane and Von Glinov, 2008).  Here Shane and Von Glinov did not encourage any \nteam to appoint a leader who has limited ability in a specified skill.  Now Facebook is getting \nmore popular not only among youngsters in social networking but also among teachers.  They \nshared messages, pictures, video clips and they can use it for studying purposes. e -mails are \npopular too.  Now how can we implement mathematics education using ICT in Malaysia.  \nThus a curriculum and syllabus for Mathematics IT came into UTHM.  The objectives of this \nstudy is to analyze the effect of learning pre-algebra using interactive courseware with \ncollaborative learning set up against a group that use mainly e-mails and facebook and \ndetermine whether e-mails and facebook help mathematics learning. \n \nMethodology \nThe structure of the experiment is shown in Figure 1 below. \n \n \n \n \n Entry Stop \n \n \n \n \n \n|\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026|\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026|\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026| \nWeek0         Week1                                                                                   Week9           Week10 \n \nFigure 1.  Basic Structure of the experimentation \n \nThis structure was agreed since calculus came during Week 7 and Week 8 of 1DIT \nMathematics I.T. syllabus.  Between Week 3 to Week 6 they were exposed to more algebra, \nDiscrete Mathematics and Series. CDiCL used ADDIE methodology under multimedia \ninteractive courseware development.  It was tested in Polytechnic Kota Bharu, Kelantan and a \nsecondary school in Pasir Mas, Kelantan in 2006. (Mohd Sazali Khalid, 2010). The content of \nthe cd has more than 10 topics under pre-algebra, factorization and simplification. It was \nrecommended that CDiCL would be more effective if it was used with lower size team of 3 \nas compared to bigger size team of five. \n \nResearch Procedure \nQuasi-experimental design was employed where it was not possible to randomize any \nstudent to participate.  Group I (Control using CDiCL and CL only)    n=30;   22 girls 8 boys.  \nThe students were academically equivalent as their entry was controlled by MOHE. \n \nLearning Processes \nFirst week, they were explained about the study to compare effectiveness studying \nmathematics IT using CD-ROM and CL against another group learning mathematics using e-\nmail  only).  They were asked to sit for PRE-TEST and after ninth week the POST TEST was \nconducted. Both tests had similar questions. Marks from pre and post test are taken as \ncoursework marks in their diploma program. They are divided into two different groups size \nPre-Test \n \n \n \n \nCDiCL with \nelaboration(n=30) \nEmail & \nFacebook (n=45) \nPost-Test \n 4th International Conference on Science and Mathematics Education 2011  \n5 \n \n18 and 12 of them.  The first group came at 0800 am and the second group came at 0900am.  \nThey were required to learn pre-algebra skills using CD-ROM called CDiCL which has 20 \ndifferent modules.  Each session they must cover at least 2 \u2013 3 modules while solving word \nproblem in between.  This was to maintain focus all along the session. The instructor selected \nthe team using math results from SPM. Each team has 5 members and they solved it \ncollaboratively using STAD (student team assessment division) set up which has a leader, \nassistant leader, reporter, manager and time keeper.  At the end of each session they must \nsubmit a report.  Computing time is about 20 \u2013 40 minutes *only.  The rest of the session is \nused by the instructor (the first author) to explain recommended solution during the CL work.  \nExample of word problem is shown in Appendix A. \nGroup II (using e-mails and facebook) - Experimented group  (n=45)  30 girls 15 \nboys.First week, they were explained about the study to compare effectiveness studying \nDiploma Mathematics IT using e-mails and facebook against learning mathematics using \nCDiCL.  They were asked to sit for PRE-TEST and after ninth week  POST TEST was \nconducted.  Marks from pre and post test were taken as coursework marks in their diploma \nprogram. Both tests have identical questions. They were divided into two different groups \nsize 25 and 20 of them.  The first group came at 0800 am and the second group came at 0900 \nam beginning 2nd week to the 9th week.   They were required to learn pre-algebra skills \nusing CDiCL that was already uploaded on the server.  Each session they must cover at least \n2 \u2013 3 modules while solving word problem in between.  This was to maintain their focus.  \nDuring the learning process they were allowed e-mail facilities and facebook within 20 \u2013 40 \nminutes only.  To enhance e-mailing work half of each team sat in different room.  The  team \nmembers was selected using results from SPM.  Each team has 5 members.  However to \nreduce face to face discussion between peers in any team,  few members of any team must  \ncome at 0900 am session but the team leader must come at 0800 am session.   To prove their \nwork, each team must submit a report to the lecturer.  This was easily done by looking at the \nlecturers\u201f weekly e-mail activities.  Computing time is about 20 \u2013 40 minutes *  per session.  \nThe rest of the time was used by the lecturer (the first author) to explain mathematics \nsolutions during their e-mail and Facebook encounters.  Similar word problem was given to \nboth group as shown in Appendix A.  \n(Note :  *  as done in MOE INTEL 2007 group among selected schools throughout the \ncountry) \n \nLearning Outcome \nThe students obtained all their marked pre and post test after the 9th week with full \nelaboration by the first author.  The recommended answers were put on paper for students\u201f \nnotes.  \nResults \nThe result was analysed using SPSS version 16.0.  Descriptive and some basic \nstatistics t-test was used in analyzing the effectiveness of these two groups.  The first author \nwas teaching both sets of students 2008 and 2009.  This is to reduce biasness and any \ndiscrepancies (extraneous variables) in the teaching values. The first author has more than 20 \nyears experience teaching mathematics at diploma level (Kota Bharu Polytechnic and \nUTHM).  In order to explain the result, we are going to use Table 1 as a guide.  \nTable 1 \nFramework for explaining the outcomes \nInput Process Output \n 4th International Conference on Science and Mathematics Education 2011  \n6 \n \nTeaching method (the \nINDEPENDENT \nVARIABLE) \n \nElaborated explanations, quality and \nquantity of explanations from \nCDiCL quality of interactions \u2013 \nPeer-to-peer; student-lecturer from \nCollaborative Learning Perceptions \nof peers and lecturers; \nE-mails, facebooks \nQuantity of learning \u2013score \nfrom test -  DEPENDENT \nVARIABLE \u2013 gain score. \n \n \nIn this section two types of results are shown.   \n \nQuantitative and Qualitative Results. \nQuantitative Results  \nDescriptive statistics in terms of the Gain score (difference between post and pre test \nscore) is shown in Figure 2. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. \nDescriptive statistics of the two different participating groups \n` Here the control group mean is three times than the experimental group even though \nstandard deviation between them is almost equal.

For these data, Levene\u201fs test is \nnon-significant so we read the test statistics in the row labeled Equal Variance assumed.  This \nagain implies of homogeneity of variances is met.  Looking at the mean difference of 2.51 \nand the standard error difference of 0.554.  In the case of 2-tailed test of p equals to 0.0031 \nwhich is smaller than 0.05, we could conclude there was a significant difference between \nthese two groups of  1DIT students in UTHM.  In terms of the experiment we can infer that \nstudents are not equally excited to use a courseware CDiCL delivered through the server with \nsome collaborative learning against another group of DIT students using e-mails and \nFacebook.  Calculating the effect size,  a score of 0.45 was obtained which is substantial.  \n(Fields,2000). \n \nQualitative Results \nWhile doing the experiments, the following data were obtained through audio \nrecording (handsets). \nItems and characteristics Advantages Disadvantages \nCD-ROM known as CDiCL Easy to understand and \ncontrol  \n \nBoring / not the state of the \nart \nCollaborative learning  for \nthey are  sitting  in pairs     \n \nPeer to peer discussion on \nword problem.  More \nmembers talking in Malay.  \nThe mathematics concepts \nare relayed in BM by the \ninstructor too.   \n \nThe worthiness of their \ndiscussion depends on the \nreadiness of the members in \neach team.  If they are all \nready, the discussion is more \nfruitful. \ne-mails only; FB; they sit by \nthemselves alone  \n \n \nIt looked more conducive, \nthe state of the art.  \n \nInteresting but lonely.  The \nstudent cannot walk all over \nthe places to discuss many \nthings.  They just e-mail their \nproblems and suggested \nsolution (if any). \ne-mail They can write anything they \nlike but Bahasa Malaysia was \nused in their e-mails and \nmore relax. \n \nThey cannot talk as freely as \nwhat they used to do all this \ntime. They can only emails or \nFacebook.  \n \nFacebook They looked happier.  They \ncan see their friends faces.   \nThey have to think a bit more  \nopinions and criticisms.  \n \n 4th International Conference on Science and Mathematics Education 2011  \n8 \n \nWhat could be gained from this qualitative data was firstly many students enjoyed \nusing e-mails and facebook since this was the trend among youngsters.  But their mood \nwould slightly change if they faced difficulties getting feedback from peers and what more if \nthey were e-mailing some ideas and solution by himself alone in the laboratory.   \n \nDiscussion \nIn this study 75 Diploma Information Technology from UTHM students took part and \nthey were put into two different groups.  One studied in 2008/09 session and the other one \n2009/10 session.  The first group used CDiCL courseware with collaborative learning set up \nwhile the second group practiced electronic mails and Facebook to learn algebra topics.  The \nfirst author was the only mathematics instructor among the two groups.  From the result \nsection, e-mail group did not do so well as compared to CDiCL and collaborative learning \ngroup. The average gain score obtained from the e-mail group and Facebook is lower than the \nold collaborative learning group using CDiCL.  This implies that stability among group \nmembers of 3 is important to be achieved as face to face discussion is more fruitful than e-\nmails and facebook during mathematics learning. And this concurs with Zain et al (2006), \nTan, (2007), Razali (2008), Shane and Glinov (2008).  May be the members lost their focus \nonce they got facebook as the facility to learn since the students suddenly changed their mood \nto study through computers and this concurs with MOE INTEL 2007 report.  Word problem \nsolving exercises could be more effective in Malaysian language ( Mohd Sazali, 2010b) and \nthis was so not well demonstrated by the second group using e-mails and facebook. \nThe contribution of this paper is that students would do better if they were trained to \nthink more outside their box.  This came with some creativity and innovative from lecturers\u201f \nsides i.e., collaborative learning method besides some use teaching aids likes CDiCL.  Their \nwork in the computer laboratory must be guided with some sort of \u201eword problem\u201f solving \ntasks within specified time length  in order for them to focus  what  would the outcome of \neach of their computer session.  The experiment in FTMM UTHM DIT Year 1 was \ndifferently done than schools that participated in MOE INTEL 2007 program where in \nFTMM more \u201esolid question\u201e was prepared as the main guide to the computer laboratory \nwork.   In MOE Intel report 2007 some students complained they were more advanced than \nthe teachers in getting correct web sites for learning purposes. The limitation was the students \nwere still so new to this style of learning since they were the first semester students in \nUTHM.  Another obstacle was understanding algebra, English and Malay when mathematics \nhas its own language and concepts as well.  Word problem solving exercises was roped in \ninto their work to glue things up (technology, languages and mathematics) and it was \neffective only if the teams collaborated well as proven in 1DIT 2008/09 batch of students.  \nFrom interview, few students complained they understood a lot even though their marks was \nlow and this contrasted to their peers who gained high marks but they understood less \nMathematics IT.  In sum, 1DIT students  had gained new learning and teachings skills. \n \nConclusion \nThis quasi-experimental method used two batches of diploma IT students 2008/09 and \n2009/10.  It presented a pedagogical approach i.e., using computers in learning mathematics \nin Collaborative Learning set-up as compared to learning using e-mails and facebook \ntechnology.  The former group did better from social interaction between teams as found in \ntheir gain scores ( difference in marks between Post and Pre Tests) as compared to the latter.  \n 4th International Conference on Science and Mathematics Education 2011  \n9 \n \nNew learning and teaching experience was obtained among the participants and the result can \nhelp UTHM to decide employing future technology.  \n \n \nAcknowledgement \nUTHM and FTMM/FSKTM for allowing in conducting this study.

This paper analyses the efforts of \nMalaysian TVE higher education institutions in the attempt to internationalize their education through \nexpanding the number of international students. The focus is then narrowed to one major player of the TVE \ninstitution particularly to the trend of its international students\u2019 recruitment from the Middle Eastern and \nAfrican regions.  This paper reviews the education system in related regions and outlines how doctoral \nresearch is being set up to investigate on the academic adjustment of international students from these \nregions into the Malaysian TVE setting. \n \nKeywords: internationalization, higher education, Middle East and Africa, international students, technical \nand vocational education. \n \n1. Introduction \nThis paper attempts to outline the background that \ninforms the scene of a doctoral research that focuses on \nacademic adjustment of international students in a single \nnon-Western institution setting.  The paper starts with the \nbigger view of the discipline, the framework, and brief \ninformation on the education system in the institution and \nthe country of origin of the biggest population in the \ninstitution, the Middle East and Africa. The discussion \nthen narrows to the gap of literature, and finally towards \nsetting up the doctoral scene.  \n \n2. Internationalization of higher education  \nInternationalization of higher education is defined in \nseveral ways. Despite of the various attempts to define \nthe term, Knight in particular has attempted towards this \neffort and her latest working definition describes \ninternationalization of higher education as \u2018the process of \nintegrating an international, intercultural or global \ndimension into the purpose, functions or delivery of post-\nsecondary education\u2019 [1].  \nThe definition given by Knight is stratified into \nthree levels; the national, the sector, and the institutional \n[1, 2]. National and sector levels have big influences on \ninternationalizing higher education through political \ninvolvement. These influences include the development \nof internationalization policies, social and cultural issues, \nas well as economic or funding. It influences the top-\ndown effect in the process of internationalization. \nInstitutional level plays the role in delivering the ideas \nprepared by the national and sector levels by providing \nsufficient and appropriate supports. For example, \nhandling academic issues and facilitating academic \nexchanges such as students and staff mobility, and \nresearch collaboration. Institutional level portrays the \nbottom-up forces which affect the internationalization \nprocess, demonstrating the relationships between all \nlevels involved. The relationship on the role of national, \nsector and institutional level in the internationalization of \nhigher education is expressed in figure 1.1.   \nAlthough Knight\u2019s internationalization framework is \nwidely accepted, it was recently extended to another two \nlevels represented by Sanderson [3]; supranational and \nwithin-institutional level. These two levels contain other \ntwo layers for each level; global and regional layers for \nthe supranational level, and faculty/department and \nindividual layers within the within-institutional level as \ndescribed in figure 1.2.  \n \n \nFigure 1.1 The internationalization dimensional \nframework [1] \n*Corresponding author: sofurah@uthm.edu.my \n2012 UTHM Publisher. All right reserved. \npenerbit.uthm.edu.my/ojs/index.php/ijie \n1\nNur Sofurah Mohd Faiz et al., Int. J. Of Integrated Engineering Vol. {} No. {} (2012) p. {} \n \n \nIn agreement of Knight\u2019s established framework, \nSanderson justified that the framework did complement \nthe internationalization processes and strategies in the \n1990s where there were less rapid movement and \nactivities of internationalization. In the contrary, the \nframework did not evolve clearly as the definition. \nKnight obviously has redefined the definition to respond \nto new challenges and realities and hence become the \nreason of its wide acceptance by other researchers. For \nthe framework however, Sanderson justified that the \ninternationalization process is now progressing towards \nan advanced phase of environment which is more mature, \ncompetitive and complex. Following the evolvements \ntherefore, Knight\u2019s framework as well need to be \nreviewed to complement the progress.   \n \n \nFigure 1.2 The extended internationalization \ndimensional framework [3] \n \nAlthough Knight\u2019s focus of work is largely to the \norganizational components, it is important to \nacknowledge that stakeholders also acted as the driving \nforces that give effects and being affected by \ninternationalization process and hence, create \ninternationalization outcomes in an active and dynamic \nmanner [3]. Thus, the depth of these dimensions has to be \nexplored. Sanderson further suggested that, to understand \nthe processes and effects of internationalization, it is \nessential to investigate the purposes, practices and \nexperiences of key stakeholders at all levels to \ndemonstrate the dynamic interactions between the layers. \nThe findings, to some extent, provide an indicator of the \neducation quality which is in line with the ultimate aim of \ninternationalization of higher education.  \n \nAdjustment: \u2018fitting in\u2019 one-way vs. two-ways  \nIn earlier research, adjustment was viewed as the \ntargeted phase after a series of excitement, shock; anxiety \nand stress are gone through by the sojourners [e.g. 4, \nLysgaard in 5, 6]. Yet, after the introduction of the idea  \nthat learning process is actually a dynamic experience, \nadjustment is seen as the interactive process between the \nstudent and the new environment which is directed \ntowards \u2018fitting in\u2019 appropriately to the new institutional \ncontext [7-10]. \u2018Fitting in\u2019 however, is vague and should \nbe described as neither a simple nor direct process. It \nneeds how Matsumoto [11] described it as \u2018affective \nevaluation of one\u2019s life\u2019 [11] which explains the \ncapability of a person to critically reflect their own \npersonal previous experiences and upbringings at the \nsame time appreciate and negotiate the new experience \nwhich is often different from their norms to function \naccordingly and effectively in the new environment. The \nnew environment consist variables which is also \nresponsive towards changes, including the changes of \nnorms which respond to the existence of international \nstudents [e.g. 12, 13, 14]. Thus, the new environment is \nnot only for international students. Having a significant \nnumber of international students in an institution is also a \nnew environment for the host members of the institution. \nFollowing this, scholars suggest that intercultural \nawareness is promoted to the existing society in the new \nenvironment [14]. By being aware of the other\u2019s \ndifferences and similarities, the existing culture creates \nflexible environment and sustainable education [15].   \nDue to this whole experiences, the whole scenario \nthen of learning and teaching become both a challenge \nand opportunity. The progress of internationalisation of \nhigher education is no longer politically student export \nindustry, yet is towards a sustainable education that \nemphasises social and personal benefits to all the \nindividuals involved [14-16]. It offers mutual learning \nand personal growth which is nurtured through personal \nmotivation and understanding as well as institutional \nsupport [17].  To adjust in a multicultural environment is \nno longer viewed as monotonous efforts done by \ninternational students, nonetheless a reciprocal learning \ndevelopment for both international students and the host \nmembers including the academic staff. When both parties \naccordingly \u2018adjust\u2019 to the academic environment they \nare involved in, both should be able to accommodate the \nlearning and teaching through understanding, negotiating \nand responding positively to the needs of each other, the \ncurriculum is made accessible for the diverse cultural \nbackgrounds [15, 18]. It is this stance that this doctoral \nstudy makes in looking into adjustment of international \nstudents. This study uses the term mutual adjustment, \nwhich emphasises adjustment is a reciprocal effort from \nboth international students and academic staff.  \n \n3. The culture synergy model \nThe model and its emphasis \nThe culture synergy model is the only model that \nexplicitly emphasises the development from the view of \nacademic cultural transition involving both international \nstudents and academic staff. This model describes the \ntheory of intercultural stereotypes and the applicability in \npromoting mutual adjustment in the case of different \nacademic cultures. The model was first developed based \non the study of different stereotypes between Chinese \nstudents in a British setting. It was originally developed \nby Jin in 1992 and continued to be significant to date in \nrelated disciplines from the collaborative work of Jin and \n 2 \nNur Sofurah Mohd Faiz et al., Int. J. Of Integrated Engineering Vol. {} No. {} (2012) p. {} \n \n \nCortazzi [19, 20]. It has also been used in other research \nconcerning the adjustment of international students with \nfocus on adjustment as reciprocal efforts from \ninternational students, and the host members  [13].  \nThere are contradictions on intercultural stereotypes \nthat emerged from the Chinese students. One of them is \nthey perceive teachers teaching should not be questioned, \ninstead should be received and obeyed. For British \neducators however, their stereotype thinking was for \nstudents to participate and express their thoughts to allow \ninteractive interactions so that they could facilitate and \nguide students to be more creative and independent. \nAlthough either party could not be perceived as the \ncorrect method to learn or to teach, the common scenario \nwould be that international students are simply required \n(either consciously or unconsciously) to assimilate host \nnations ways. This forms a one-way adaptation, and often \nthere will be conflicts in learning and teaching \nexpectations from both which normally mismatch from \neach other. In such cases, changes do not happen \ncognitively, therefore there will be negative influence on \ninteractions and hinder what Cortazzi and Jin described as \n\u2018culture learning\u2019 in academic activities. Jin further \nproposes for a process of \u2018culture synergy\u2019, a process that \nrequires both teachers and students to acknowledge the \nculture of one and another. \nJin\u2019s culture synergy model got its name from the \ndefinition of synergy which means \u2018working together\u2019. \nBriefly, the model reflects the theory it explains \u2013\u2018culture \nsynergy means that people from two or more cultures, \nworking in an academic environment, interact \nsystematically, cooperating for a common purpose with \nan attitude of being willing to learn, understand and \nappreciate the other\u2019s culture without loss of their own \nstatus, role or cultural identity\u2019 [20]. Culture synergy \npromotes the idea of adjustment as a bidirectional \nprocess, and that adjustment has to be from reciprocal \nefforts between the international students and academic \nstaff, towards a mutual adjustment. This has the same \npurpose of integration that is promoted in the adjustment \ntheories, the understanding that has been promoted by \nDavis regarding the importance of intercultural awareness \nin the new era of international education, and the main \nfactor that influences the use of this model in this study.  \n \n4. Internationalization of the Malaysian \nTVE \nThe pressure to internationalize impacted the \neducation system in Malaysia including TVE sector that \nwas first developed for national agenda [21, 22]. The \ninterdependence of countries had increased the mobility \nof students to search for the best education they could get. \nFor Malaysian higher education institutions therefore, this \ncondition has forced them towards providing graduates \nthat is competent in the international industry market \n[23]. Institutions started to compete to fulfill the demand \nof high skill and competent workforces that could master \npractical and theoretical knowledge and skills[24]. The \ndebates on the importance of such workers, to some \nextent are the responsibilities of the Malaysian TVE \ninstitutions [25, 26].  \nIn the higher education level, the Malaysian \nTechnical University Network (MTUN) particularly felt \nthe impact and hold the responsibilities to react to such \ndemanding global market [27].  MTUN universities have \nstarted their efforts of internationalization by making \ntheir education attractive. Thus to date, MTUN \nuniversities have been collaborating with foreign \nuniversities as well as recruiting a number of international \nstudents that increases each year in various TVE courses. \nUntil 2010, the official number of international students \nin MTUN institutions was 521 international students and \n710 in the end of 2010 in both bachelor and postgraduate \ndegree [28]. These students, in hierarchical order, come \nfrom Indonesia, the Middle East, Africa and other \nneighboring South East Asian countries (MTUN \nuniversities websites).   \n \n5. The major player \u2013 the Malaysian \nTechnical and Vocational University \n(MTVU) \nAmong MTUN institutions, the Malaysian Technical \nand Vocational University (MTVU, a pseudonym) is the \nmost active university in recruiting international students. \nAlthough the other three MTUN universities do listed \nrecruiting international students is one of their agenda in \ntheir internationalization strategies, to date their focuses \nare towards collaboration of research and international \nindustries (MTUN universities websites). There are \ninternational students enrolled in their courses, yet still \nvery minimum compared to MTVU. In addition, \ninternational students in MTVU consist more than 80% of \nthe population of international students among MTUN \nuniversities. For this reason, MTVU was chosen as the \nresearch site for this particular study. \nInternational students were first recruited in 2004 \nand as in 31st of March 2010 MTVU has more than 200 \ninternational students. These students are 90% male \nundergraduate students from the Middle Eastern and \nAfrican continent (North and East specifically) \nparticularly from Libya (31.8%), Yemen (18.5%) and \nSomalia (27.2%) (Statistical report of international \nstudents, personal email comm., MTVU international \nofficer, 31 March 2010). The rest are from neighboring \nSouth East Asian countries such as Indonesia, Myanmar, \nColumbia and Brunei. Majority are enrolled in the \nengineering disciplines which are civil, electrical and \nmechanical. Hence, any descriptions and discussion in \nlatter part focuses majorly to engineering disciplines. \nMTVU requires students entering courses in the \nengineering discipline to have at least a diploma \nqualification or equivalent which is recognized by the \ngovernment of Malaysia and approved by the senate of \nthe University.  \nThe structure of curriculum in engineering \ndisciplines in MTVU follows the demand for MTUN \ninstitutions. Thus, it was designed in an emphasis applied \nknowledge skills which are hands-on and application of \nlecture learning in the real world of work. Students \n 3\nNur Sofurah Mohd Faiz et al., Int. J. Of Integrated Engineering Vol. {} No. {} (2012) p. {} \n \n \nenormously involved in applied engineering subjects that \ncomprise project type of assignments, calculation in \nlectures and tutorials, site visits, laboratory sessions and \nindustrial training.  Some courses also include field work \nand industrial visits throughout their candidature. In the \nfinal semester of a student\u2019s candidature, each student \ncompletes a work placement in industry to give them \nexposure to the world of work for the engineering \nprofession. The placement allows students to apply the \nhands-on skills they learned while in MTVU into the real \nsituation.  \n \nEducation in the Middle East and Africa \nThere is scarcity of research focusing on education \nsystem in the Middle East and African continents. \nResearch accounts only one tenth of one per cent of the \nworld\u2019s research combined [29]. However, growing \ninterest of research in Middle Eastern and North African \n(MENA) countries was revealed after the governments \nexhibited significant commitments to human capital \ngrowth through education [30]. International students in \nMTVU largely come from these regions, except there are \na number of students from a country in East Africa. For \nthis specific country, there is almost no research or \nreliable information that is related given by trusted \nsources such as the World Bank, United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \n(UNESCO) or the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \n(UNICEF). Thus, this section provides overall \ndiscussions highly angled to the countries in the MENA \nregions.  \nIn brief, the quality of education is least susceptible \nin comparison to other developing countries. This is due \nto substantial differences on curriculum structures and \ncontents, inadequate resource management, and negative \nattitudes towards the importance of Mathematics and \nScience [31, 32]. Although access to education to date is \nimproved with particular financial progress in oil-\nexporting, the task to serve education to its tremendous \nyoung population  is huge and challenging [33]. The most \nconcern issue is the rate of limited school facilities that \ncould suffice the demographic pressure. Besides this, the \npressure is also to the low education opportunities and \ngender inequalities [34].  \nMENA countries reflect similar learning and \nteaching pedagogical method in primary, secondary and \ntertiary level. Students fully rely on their teachers whose \npedagogy was almost solely on illustrating concepts \nduring lectures and reading from textbooks [31] . \nAssessment methods are entirely exam-oriented where \nrewards are given for the absorption of knowledge \nusually transmitted by the teachers in class and the \nsources the students have read [35, 36]. Therefore, \nmemorizing is a vital skill, and almost no applications on \nconcepts are learned. In secondary education, teachers are \nregarded as absolute authority and are respected by \nstudents. Teachers normally do the knowledge searching \nand inform the students the knowledge they have to \nknow. With this style of teaching, students prefer to be \ntold exactly what and how to learn new things [37]. The \ncommon language for the MENA people is Arabic [38]. \nInfluenced by the spread of Islam in educational reforms, \nArabic is commonly used as the formal language with \nEnglish is taught as a subject from secondary school \nonwards [39]. English language in the society is used \namong those who have had education from an English \nbased school and largely by the expatriates and \nacademics. Information in TVE is as well limited. What \nis known to date is the education of TVE does not \nprovide significant impact on labor markets [33]. This is \nbecause the common situation of early dropouts and \nchildren labor does not promote further education and \nhigher training. However, the privatization and \nacknowledgement of World Bank towards these countries \nhave assisted the awareness of continuous education and \nthus, governments of the MENA countries started to \nimprove and expand their education system towards \nenhancing practical and generic skills [30]. \n \n6. Gap of literature \nThe discourse on the adjustment of international students \ndominantly focus on the movements of Asian students to \na Western developed country such as the US, UK, NZ \nand Australia [e.g. 13, 40, 41]. Accordingly it is identified \nthat the pattern of the current discussion is on the \n\u2018western situation\u2019.  \nThis study basically decentralises the trend. It is \ninterested on the adjustment of Middle Eastern and \nAfrican international students to a Malaysian higher \neducation, specifically to a TVE discipline which is \nengineering field. Countries such as Singapore, China and \nMalaysia have been recently raised as the international \neducation hubs and the number of international students \nin these countries have significantly grew [15]. These \ndifferences are definitely important, to at least discuss \nlater on where the concept of internationalization, the \nidea on mutual adjustment and the understanding of \nculture synergy model could lead to further knowledge. \nApart from that, the Malaysian TVE context offers \ncontributions to new dimensions in the literature on \ninternational student experiences. The Malaysian TVE \ncontext might reveal new information in expanding the \nunderstanding of international students\u2019 academic \nadjustment. The differences in background of the study \nshould complement the current information of challenges \nin academic environment encountered by international \nstudents.  \n \n7. Setting up the research \nAs a way of addressing these significant gaps, a \ndoctoral study is proposed that will research the learning \nexperiences of international students and the teaching \nexperiences of academic staff in MTVU. MTVU has \nexperienced the most rapid growth of international \nstudents largely from the Middle East and Africa. Using \nsemi-structured, in-depth interviews situated in an \ninterpretive qualitative methodology, we aim to explore \nthe learning and teaching experiences from approximately \nten international students and ten academic staff through \nfocus group and individual interviews. The method \n 4 \nNur Sofurah Mohd Faiz et al., Int. J. Of Integrated Engineering Vol. {} No. {} (2012) p. {} \n \n \nadopted is the best fit for the research because experience \nis \u2018socially constructed\u2019 [44 p. 8] and the goal is to \nachieve \u2018rich\u2019, \u2018particularistic\u2019 and \u2018heuristic\u2019 \ncharacteristics [45 pp. 43-44]. The findings will then \nillustrate the current degree of reciprocal adjustment that \nis happening in the institution from learning and teaching \nperspectives. The information will be used to indicate \nfuture steps that could be taken by the institution to ease \nthe transition of international students as well as to \nsupport academic staff towards better quality in learning \noutcomes. \nIn the first instance, MTVU highlights that \napproximately 90% of international students in Malaysian \nTVE institutions come from Africa and the Middle East \n(Malaysian TVE institution international officer, 2010, \npers. comm., 30 March). The key similarity among the \nstudents themselves and the society is the shared religion, \nthat is, Islam and values associated with Islam [33]. The \nsimilarity plays an important factor in international \nstudents\u2019 decision to study in Malaysia [23]. The \nMalaysian education system which respects the practice \nof Islam (i.e. prayer time, code of ethics and behaviour) \nplays an important role as religion is the way of Islamic \nMiddle East people lead their lives [42]. Thus, it is \nanticipated that this similarity would somehow affect the \nadjustment of these students. In addition, discussion on \nlearning adjustment from students coming from these \nregions and how religion and religious values affect \nlearning experiences of international students is scant in \nthe current literature.  \nSecond, Malaysia is a South East Asian non-English \nspeaking country. The first language for Malaysian \npeople is Bahasa Melayu while international students \nfrom Middle East and Africa in this context largely use \nArabic [33]. English however, is used widely in the \nsociety and is the mode of instruction in MTVU. What \nremains unknown is how the use of English accents, \njargons, terms and idioms in the culture of the students \nand staffs affect adjustment in learning and teaching.  \nThird, there are limitations with the literature \nconcerning international students\u2019 adjustment in TVE \ninstitutions. TVE universities in Malaysia are established \nas skill-based institutions. Part of the programs offered in \nMalaysian TVE universities are engineering, technical \nand vocational education, information technology and \ntechnology management. The academic programs prepare \nstudents for professional and managerial TVE personnel \nsuch as engineers, TVE educators, information \ntechnology officers and surveyors  [Ahmad cited in 43]. \nThe information that might emerge from this dimension is \nthe international students and academic staffs\u2019 adjustment \nthat is related with learning and teaching practical skills \nand hands-on. \n \n8. Conclusion \nAs a whole, beyond these discussions on academic \nadjustment of international students is the paucity of such \nstudy in a South East Asian non-English speaking country \nsuch as Malaysia. This paper focuses on how the \nMalaysian TVE situation offers possibilities for \nexpanding our understanding of academic adjustment \nfrom the \u2018western situation\u2019 into a Malaysian TVE \ncontext. These dimensions can contribute to new \nknowledge to the existing discussion on adjustment of \ninternational students, the current discourse on the \ntheories of mutual adjustment and the idea on \ninternationalization of higher education.  \nReferences \n[1] Knight, J.

A laboratory study has been conducted to analyze the effects of different \ntypes of vegetation to the velocity and on the Manning roughness coefficient (n) in an open channel, and to \ndevelop relationships between the characteristics of the vegetation (density, type and distribution) on the \nhydraulic roughness. Plants namely Napier grass and Ipomoea Aquatica have  been selected for this study. From \nthe conducted experiments, the roughness of Napier Grass is in the range of 0.0002 \u2013 0.0073 and Ipomoea \nAquatica is 0.0002-0.0062. It was also found that the Manning\u2019s n value has a linear relationship with flow \ndepth, vegetation arrangements and density. \n \nKeywords: Manning\u2019s Coefficient, Napier Grass ,Ipomoea Aquatica, Open Channel, Flow Resistance. \n \n \n1. Introduction \n \nVegetation can be found growing naturally on \nthe beds of channels or on the riverbanks or where \nit has been purposely planted. It is often classified \nby its shape and the locations where it grows. \nVegetation growing on the river floodplains \ntypically comprises various combinations of trees, \nherbs, shrubs, hedges, bushes and grasses. \n \nThe vegetation in channel usually consists of \naquatic plants and these may be divided into four \ncategories: emergent, submerged, floating-leaf, and \nfree-floating leaf. The presence of vegetation in \nriver channels provides both benefits and problems. \nFrom an environmental point of view, aquatic \nplants are essential parts of natural aquatic systems \nand form the basis of a water body\u2019s health and \nproductivity. And from an engineering point of \nview, vegetation can improve the strength of bank \nmaterials through buttressing and root \nreinforcement.  \n \nHowever, invariably aquatic plants become over \nabundant or unsightly and require control. The \nobvious problems related to excessive growth are \nretardation, a reduction in hydraulic capacity and \nflooding. The effects of vegetation on the open \nchannel vary depending on the species, distribution, \ndensity and size of vegetation. (Jain, 2001).  \n \nAlthough the flow capacity can be increased by \ncomplete or partial removal of vegetation, this \nsolution will lead to erosion of the banks and \nincrease the sediment load carried by flowing \nwater. On the other way, unrestricted growth of \nsuch vegetation in an open channel can led to its \ncomplete loss of the hydraulic capacity. Many \nstudies have been conducted in previous years to \ninvestigate the resistance to flow provide by the \nvegetation, using either artificial or real vegetation \nat the open channel. Fathi Maghadam and N. \nKouwen (1997) used pine and cedar tree samplings \nto model the resistance to flow in a water flume.  \n \nThis study was laboratory based and focused on \nthe effects of local (tropical) plants namely Napier \nGrass (Pennisetum Purpureum) and Kangkung Air \n  2\n(Ipomoea Aquatica) on hydraulic roughness and to \ndevelop empirical relationship between the \ncharacteristics of the flow and also the \ncharacteristics of the vegetations. \n \n \n2. Experimental details \n \n2.1. Materials and Methods \n \n A series of experiments has been done to \nmeasure all the parameters (velocity, flow rate and \nchannel slope) in order to get the Manning \nroughness coefficient, n for Napier Grass \n(Pennisetum Purpureum) and Kangkung Air \n((Ipomoea Aquatica)  Table 1 shows the details for \nNapier Grass (Pennisetum Purpureum) and \nKangkung Air ((Ipomoea Aquatica). Therefore, the \nexperiments were carried out in a channel of 10 m \nlength, 0.30 m width and 0.46 m height. (Refer \nFigure (1a, 1b and 2) and Figure 3 shows the water \nlettuce planted in site. The 1: 500 ratios have been \nfixed as the channel slope of the experiments. \nDischarge is pumped through the open channel \nfrom the storage tanks.

Plan view of the flume with Pennisetum \nPurpureum   \n \nFlow is considered uniform only when the \ncross-section and flow-depth remain constant along \nthe length of flume. The test stretch was 2.5 m long \nand located at a distance of 3.75 m from the inlet. \nThe vegetation was planted in a wooden box which \nwas filled with soil. The box had a dimension of 2.5 \nm length, 0.27 m width and a height of 0.08 m.  \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Water Lettuce planted in field \n \n          The schematic drawing of the experimental \nsetup is shown on Figure 4. The mean velocities of \nflow in channel were measured using an area-\nvelocity flow meter. The mean velocities were then \n  3\nused to compute Manning\u2019s roughness coefficient \nusing Manning\u2019s equation. \n \n \n \nFigure. 4: Schematic drawing of the experimental \nsetup \n \nThere were a few important factors needed \nto determine the effect of vegetation on the \nroughness of an open channel. (Density/quantities, \ndistribution, flow-depth and vegetation physical \ncharacteristics). The test was also carried out \nwithout vegetation for control and checking \nmechanism. To investigate the relationship between \nflow depth and Manning\u2019s n; a fixed set of three \nflow depths (0.18 m, 0.20 m and 0.22 m) was \nadopted. The different instrument depth (0.0035 m \nand 0.0070 m) also taken to see the effect of \nvarious depth clearly. Uniform flow is fixed by \nensure that the flow depth is constant along the \nchannel. The height and diameter of the vegetation \n(Napier Grass) used is fixed at 0.40 m height and \n0.5 cm - 1.0 cm in diameter. \n \n \n \nFigure .5 : Velocity measurement location \nfor both specimens. \n \nThe mean velocity was measured in 6 different \nlocations in the vegetated zone (Figure 5) (and the \naverage of the mean velocity was used to calculate \nthe Manning\u2019s roughness coefficient, n. The \nexperiments were then repeated with two different \ndensities of plant vegetation; 5 veg/m2 and 10 \nveg/m2 with different flow depth to investigate the \nrelationship between vegetation density and \nManning\u2019s n. To investigate the effects of \nvegetation arrangements on Manning\u2019s n, two \ndifferent vegetation arrangements were used. This \nfirst arrangement is used to simulate the vegetation \nin both sides and center of the channel; the second \narrangement was used to simulate staggered \ndistribution of vegetation across the channel length \n(vegetated zone). Figure 6 shows the vegetation \narrangements for both densities.

The factor \nthat contributed to these phenomena is type of plant \nwhich Napier Grass is an emergent plant while \nKangkung Air is a free floating plant. Napier Grass \nacts more to reduction from beneath to surface \nwhile Kangkung Air is more on the surface. The \nphysical properties of Napier Grass also \ncontributed to this situation (Branching stems, \nleaves) \n \n4. Conclusion \n \nThis study presents the effect of vegetation on the \nManning\u2019s, n in an open channel. The vegetation \nselected for this experiment is Napier Grass \n(Pennisetum Purpureum). From the experiment \nconducted that the roughness of Napier Grass is in \nrange of 0.0002 \u2013 0.0073. It is also found that the \nincreasing of Manning\u2019s n value is depending on \nthe increasing of flow depth. The vegetation \narrangement/distributions also founded to be \naffected the value of Manning\u2019s n where for \nvegetation arrangements; Type 2 (Staggered) \nrecorded increment for Manning\u2019s value at 34%-\n195% rather than Type 1 arrangements. This is \nprobably caused by almost two third of the flow \narea has been resisted than Type 1 arrangements. \nThe increasing of Manning\u2019s n value also identified \nwhen density of vegetation increased. The values of \nvelocity and flow rate were proportionally inversed \nwith Manning\u2019s n. The physical structure of Napier \nGrass with branching stems and leaves is the main \nfactor that effects the velocity distributions of flow. \n  6\nNapier Grass contributed 34%-73% to the overall \nchannel roughness depending on the quantities and \narrangements. Napier Grass (Pennisetum \nPurpureum) recorded the Manning\u2019s n value of \n17.8% more than Water Lettuce (Ipomoea \nAquatica.). As the conclusion, vegetation really \ngiving effects to the open channel on roughness \nvalue, velocity and flow.

Surveys suggest that the generic aspect demand equal if not greater emphasis in order \nto produce competent marketable graduates. However, in Malaysia many undergraduates come from \nan exam-oriented schooling system that lacks the ingredient to develop both the content and generic \nskills. Hence, a proper teaching method should be applied at tertiary level so that the students \ngraduated from universities are competent in generic skills. At University Tun Hussein Onn \nMalaysia, Problem Based Learning (PBL) has been used as a teaching and learning method since \n2005. This method was purposely selected to develop and enhance not only the technical and hard \nskills but more importantly the generic or humanistic skills of the students. A complete Self Directed \nLearning module was developed to be a systematic teaching and learning manual for both lecturers \nand students. A study was then conducted on a group of 140 students in order to see the impact of \nPBL on the development of students\u2019 humanistic skills. This is a descriptive survey research in which \nit utilises both quantitative and qualitative data. The finding shows that the PBL method has \nsuccessfully developed many of the essential humanistic skills of the students. Some suggestions \nhave been made for future studies and to improve the implementation of PBL among lecturers. \n \nKeywords: Problem Based Learning, learning skills, generic skills, humanistic skills, undergraduates   \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nChanges taking place at tertiary level education concerning the knowledge development and \ncurrent technological advancement had also brought some great impacts on the teaching and learning \napproaches. Hence, excellent teaching and learning becoming one of the critical success factors that a \nuniversity or polytechnic should pay more attention. Most recent, teaching and learning process at \ntertiary level had been discovered to be stagnant with the over utilization of lecturing approach. \nKnowledge, skills and values are failed to be delivered satisfactorily to the students due to the single \nway approach of teaching and learning which centered mostly around lecturers. Many of the public \nuniversities graduates were claimed to be passive and unable to perform their job. Failures during \ninterview sessions surprisingly increased due to the inability of the graduates to communicate \neffectively and to convince the employers of their humanistic and social skills.  \n \nGovernment as well as educationists all over the country had sensed this situation and the \nissues have been taken into serious consideration. The Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education for \ninstance has requested all public universities to tackle this problem immediately through the \nintroduction of generic skills or soft skills programs. Since then the efforts had been put into \nimplementation accordingly. One critical way to improve the generic skills of the students is to opt \nfor a proper approach in teaching and learning called the experiential learning in which learning \ncentered around the students rather than lecturers. Unfortunately, most of the public universities are \nstill prone to the rampant utilization of lecturer-centered teaching and learning approaches. They are \nfar from realizing the important of student-centered and experiential learning approaches in order to \nInternational Conference on Human Capital Development (ICONHCD 2009), 25-27 May 2009, Kuantan, Pahang \nISBN 978-967-5080-51-7\u0001\n \n 2 \nsuit the needs of the students, the current knowledge and the technological advancement. It was \namong the major purpose of this research to study the implementation of experiential learning \napproach particularly PBL as tool to enhance the humanistic skills of the undergraduates at a \nMalaysian public university. \n \n \nEXPERIENTIAL LEARNING \n \nCognitive and experiential are two most essential types of learning. For some reasons, \ncognitive learning often seen as meaningless and experiential learning on the other hand seen as \nsignificant. Cognitive learning is connected to the process of learning academic knowledge such as \nvocabulary or multiplication tables. It was basically a type of rote learning focuses mainly on the \nmemorization of facts or associations (Ausubel, 1961 and Slavin, 1991). Experiential learning on the \nother hand, is the learning process concerns about the application of knowledge such as learning \nabout engines in order to repair a car. According to Rogers (1961) the key to the distinction between \nthese two types of learning is that experiential learning addresses the needs and wants of the learner. \nIt also possesses other essential qualities including the personal involvement of the students, self-\ninitiated and self-evaluated and above all, it has a pervasive effects on learner.  \n \nExperiential learning is equivalent to personal change and growth. All human beings possess \na natural propensity to learn. Therefore, the critical role of the teacher is to facilitate such learning by \nsetting a positive climate for learning, clarifying the purposes of the learners, organizing and making \navailable learning resources, balancing intellectual and emotional components of learning, and \nsharing feelings and thoughts with learners but not dominating. Learning will eventually facilitated \nwhen the student participates completely in the learning process and has control over its nature and \ndirection. Evaluation or assessment in experiential learning is based on self-evaluation which is the \nprincipal method to assess the progress or the success of the learning. Learning will also be \nfacilitated when the students are given the opportunity to directly confront with practical, social, \npersonal or research problems. Furthermore, experiential learning should also stress upon the \nimportance of learning to learn (Patterson, 1973 and Valett, 1977).  \n \nBorzak (1981) stresses that experiential learning involves a direct encounter with the \nphenomena being studied rather than merely thinking about the encounter, or only considering the \npossibility of doing something about it. Most often, this sort of learning is sponsored by formal \neducational institutions and it was usually well planned.  Students will normally be given an \nopportunity to acquire and apply knowledge, skills and feelings in an immediate and relevant setting.  \n \nEfforts have been made to develop proper theories and models for the application of \nexperiential learning approach. David A. Kolb and Roger Fry had worked together to develop their \nmodel of experiential learning. The model consisted of four important elements, the concrete \nexperience, the observation and reflection, the formation of abstract concepts and testing in new \nsituations. The model was widely used and discussed in the theory and practice of adult education, \ninformal education and lifelong learning.  \n \nK.P. Cross (1981) has developed an experiential learning model called the Characteristics of \nAdults as Learners (CAL) model. The model was developed based on her analysis of lifelong \nlearning programs and it attempts to integrate other theoretical frameworks for adult learning such as \nKnowles\u2019 theory of andragogy, Rogers\u2019 theory of experiential learning and lifespan psychology. \nKnowles' theory of andragogy is an attempt to develop a theory specifically for adult learning. He \nemphasizes that adults are self-directed and expect to take responsibility for decisions. Learning \nprograms in adult learning therefore must accommodate this fundamental aspect.  \n \nApart from Rogers, Kolb, Cross, Knowles and other modern theorists, there are some other \nscholars who preceded the quest for the establishment of experiential learning theories. Al-Ghazali, \nInternational Conference on Human Capital Development (ICONHCD 2009), 25-27 May 2009, Kuantan, Pahang \nISBN 978-967-5080-51-7\u0001\n \n 3 \nan 11th century Muslim traditional scholar has long ago practiced and narrated some sorts of \nexperiential learning he was personally embarked. He distinguished between cognitive learning and \nexperiential learning during his search for the reality of the existence. In his book entitled \u2018Al-\nMunqidh min al-Dhalal\u2019 or the Deliverance from Errors he mentioned that reading and \nmemorization of a book or books would not be able to bring a proper understanding and satisfy the \nlearners. He himself has read and memorized a vast number of books including the one composed by \nAbu Talib al-Makki, the great scholar of his time. Unfortunately he felt that he has not fully \nunderstood the book very well. Thus, he embarked into a spiritual and practical journey which took \nhim 10 years to discover the true knowledge and the reality of the existence (Al-Ghazali, 1983). It \nwas his very personal experience that tells us how important is for us to embark into experiential \nlearning approach.  \n \nExperiential learning is a theoretical root for Problem Based Learning (PBL) approach. \nNonetheless, not all PBL approaches were built on the same experiential learning theories. In \nDenmark, the PBL approach was built on Dewey\u2019s theories of experiential learning. Other PBL \napproaches built on Kolb and other theories of experiential learning (Graaff and Kolmos, 2003). This \ndiversity does not bring significant differences among various PBL approaches practiced around the \nglobe. The key point here is that PBL is widely accepted as the most practical approach for \nexperiential learning particularly in terms of developing the generic and humanistic skills of the \nstudents. This study is among a number of studies conducted purposely to prove the effectiveness of \na systematic PBL approach that could enhance not only the academic but also the generic part of the \nlearning.  \n \n \nPBL AS A POWERFUL TEACHING AND LEARNING TOOL \n \nLearning activities in humanities study are not as interesting as before. The students get \neasily bored during the classroom activities and get sleepy when the lecturers start to introduce the \ntopic of the day. The student enrolment in humanities study was also decline dramatically bringing \nsome of the established faculties in many universities to the risk of closing some of their programs. \nMany factors contributed to the lack of interest among students to enrol in humanities study. The lack \nof potential jobs for humanities and social studies graduates is among the major factors.  \n \nHowever, the important of the humanities study to the students in other areas especially the \nengineering and other applied sciences increased tremendously due to the absence of the generic \nskills among the graduates. Humanities study therefore is very essential to these students so that they \ncan be trained to develop their generic and humanistic skills. On the other hand, studying the \nhumanities subjects does not necessarily enabling the students to develop their humanistic and \ngeneric skills especially when learning approach is not properly selected and implemented. Thus, in \nthis aspect a suitable learning approach should be properly selected so that the students\u2019 generic skills \ncould be well developed.  \n \nTeachers and lecturers in humanities studies have long practising the lecturing and lecturer-\ncentered approach. Most often the knowledge has been wrapped up by the lecturers and thrown out to \nthe students within four walls of the classroom. Students are far from learning the knowledge through \nmeaningful approach. Knowledge becomes saturated and stagnant. Realizing this situation, a group \nof lecturers at Center for Humanities Studies, University Tun Hussein Onn (UTHM) had \nimplemented the  Problem Based Learning in humanities studies since end of 2005. Since its first \nimplementation in 2005, a number of studies on the students\u2019 acceptance of PBL and the \neffectiveness of the module were conducted. Table 1 below lists the studies previously conducted on \nthe implementation of PBL at UTHM.  \n \nInternational Conference on Human Capital Development (ICONHCD 2009), 25-27 May 2009, Kuantan, Pahang \nISBN 978-967-5080-51-7\u0001\n \n 4 \nTable 1 \nStudies Conducted on PBL \n \nDuration Focus of the Study Instrument Findings \nDecember \n2005- April \n2006 \nThe implementation \nof PBL \nInterview Students are satisfied with the \nimplementation of PBL \nJuly \u2013 \nOctober \n2006 \nThe implementation \nof PBL \nQuestionnaire Students are satisfied with the \nimplementation of PBL and a number \nof generic/humanistic skills were \ngained \nDecember \n2006 \u2013 \nOctober \n2007 \nThe implementation \nof POPBL \nQuestionnaire \nand Interview \nStudents are satisfied with the \nimplementation of PBL and a large \nnumber of generic/humanistic skills \nwere gained \nDecember \n2007 \u2013 April \n2008 \nThe implementation \nof Self Directed \nLearning for PBL \nQuestionnaire \nand Interview \nStudents are highly satisfied with the \nmodule and a number of \ngeneric/humanistic skills were gained \n \nOut of these studies, there were a number of papers presented at national and international \nseminars and conferences. Apart from that, there was also a book entitled \u201cPembelajaran \nBerasaskan Masalah Untuk Pembangunan Komuniti Lestari\u201d compiled by the researchers and \npublished by UTHM in 2009. The book is essentially a compilation and content analysis of students\u2019 \nexperiences conducting the projects during the historic flood disaster hitting Johore and other \nsouthern parts of Peninsular Malaysia at the end of 2006 and early 2007. This paper will purposely \ndiscuss in detail the findings of the study on the implementation of PBL using Self Directed Learning \nModule, i.e. during December 2007 \u2013 April 2008 study.  \n \n \nOBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY \n \nThe objective of the study is to identify; \n1. Students\u2019 overall perception on PBL as a new approach of learning \n2. Students\u2019 perception on the effectiveness of PBL in developing their learning motivation and \nskills \n3. Students\u2019 perception on the effectiveness of PBL in enhancing their generic skills \n \nBased on the above objectives we could list down among the most critical research questions that \nneed to answered; \n1. How was the overall perception of the students about PBL as a new approach of learning \nafter they have concluded one semester of learning? \n2. What is the perception of the students on the effectiveness of PBL in increasing their \nlearning skills and motivation? \n3. What is perception of the students on the effectiveness of PBL in enhancing their generic \nskills? \n \n \nMETHOD OF THE STUDY \n \nThis study is a descriptive study research utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data. The \nquantitative data was collected using a set of questionnaire comprises of 25 questions using a 5 Likert \nscales of 1=Extremely disagree, 2=Disagree, 3=Uncertain, 4=Agree and 5=Extremely agree. The \nquestions were designed according to the above objectives and the research questions. The data was \nthen analyzed and reported in form of percentage and mean score. While for the qualitative data, the \nInternational Conference on Human Capital Development (ICONHCD 2009), 25-27 May 2009, Kuantan, Pahang \nISBN 978-967-5080-51-7\u0001\n \n 5 \nstudents were asked to reflect on their learning experience at the end of the semester. The reflection \nwas then analyzed using content analysis method. The qualitative data serves as a supportive for the \noverall finding.  \n  \nThe population of the study consist of 186 students from three classes taking two compulsory \nsubjects offered by Center for Humanities and Communication Studies, UTHM. The selection of the \npopulation is based on the fact that these students were exposed to PBL under the supervision of a \nsame lecturer and using the same module. A total number of 180 sets of questionnaire were \ndistributed and 140 of them returned. Out of this 140 respondents 75 of the respondents are male \n(53.6%) and 65 (46.4%) are female. The quantitative data collected was analyzed using Statistical \nPackages for Social Sciences (SPSS version 13.0). The data was reported in form of percentage and \nmean score. The five Likert scale was summarized into three scales of \u201cAgree\u201d (comprises of \n\u201cExtremely Agree\u201d [5] and \u201cAgree\u201d [4] scales, \u201cUncertain\u201d [3] and \u201cDisagree\u201d (comprises of \n\u201cExtremely Disagree\u201d [1] and \u201cDisagree\u201d [2] scales). Mean score is based on the scores between 1 \n(the lowest) and 5 (the highest).  \n \n \nDATA ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS \n \nTable 2 below shows the data on the first research question which asked, \u201chow was the \noverall perception of the students about PBL after they have concluded one semester of learning?\u201d \nFor this research question, six questions have been asked to the respondents. The data shows that a \nlarge majority of the respondents (84.3% - mean score 4.17, extremely high) agree that PBL activities \nare easy to follow.  \n \nTable 2 \nStudents\u2019 Overall Perception on PBL \n \nNo. Statement Agree Uncertain Disagree Mean SD \n1 PBL activities are easy to follow 118 \n(84.3%) \n19 \n(13.6) \n2 \n(1.4%) \n1 missing \n4.17 \nEH \n0.708 \n2.

More stunning fact shows that PBL has indeed \nchallenges the students to search for new knowledge. The data recorded 93.6% of the respondent \nagree to this fact. Does PBL more effective compare to the traditional way of learning? 83.5% (mean \nscore 4.24, extremely high) of the respondents agree that PBL does more effective compare to the \ntraditional way of learning. PBL was also seen as an interesting new way of learning. For this fact, \n80% of the respondents agreed. Although not all of the respondents were finally ready to choose PBL \nas their future way of learning, a big percentage (85%, mean score 4.32, extremely high) has voiced \nout their interest to choose PBL rather than the traditional way of learning. Many of them have seen \nthe big different brought by PBL as Siow Yen Yen, a Multimedia and Information Technology \nInternational Conference on Human Capital Development (ICONHCD 2009), 25-27 May 2009, Kuantan, Pahang \nISBN 978-967-5080-51-7\u0001\n \n 6 \nstudent reflects, \u201cI found that there are big different from the primary and secondary education \nteaching methods which concerned more about reading on moral values. I learnt about moral studies \nthrough research and how it could be applied to the real world.\u201d This view was also shared by Chan \nKai Ming, a second year Electrical and Electronic Engineering student who says, \u201cAt the end of \nsemester, I gained a special learning experience that totally different from the learning method \nduring my primary and secondary school.\u201d \n \nWhat is the perception of the respondents on the effectiveness of PBL in developing their \nmotivation and learning skills? Among the important learning skills focused in this study are self \ndirected learning, group learning, mastery of cognitive, psychomotor and affective learning aspects, \nlife long learning skill and ICT learning skill. Except for the self directed learning, a large percentage \nof respondents (as showed in table 3) i.e. more than 80%, agreed that PBL has managed to enhance \nmany of their learning skills. \n \nTable 3 \nStudents\u2019 Perception on the Effectiveness of PBL  \nin Developing Motivation and Learning Skills \n \nNo. Statement Agree Uncertain Disagree Mean SD \n6 PBL provides more opportunities to \npolish my self directed learning \nskill \n97 \n(69.3%) \n29 \n(20.7%) \n14 \n(10%) 3.86 High 0.954 \n7 PBL provides more opportunities to \nincrease my group learning skill \n122 \n(87.2%) \n15 \n(10.7%) \n3 \n(2.1%) \n4.24 \nEH 0.755 \n8 PBL increases my level of \nknowledge more compare to \nlecturing method \n114 \n(81.5%) \n22 \n(15.7%) \n3 \n(2.1%) 4.09 EH 0.727 \n9 PBL increases my skill of \nunderstanding the subject \n118 \n(84.2%) \n22 \n(15.7%) \n0 4.06 \nEH 0.614 \n10 PBL increases my level of \nmastering moral values \n121 \n(86.5%) \n17 \n(12.1%) \n2 \n(1.4%) \n4.19 \nEH 0.695 \n11 PBL encourages me to search for \nadditional learning resources  \n134 \n(95.7%) \n5 \n(3.6%) \n0 \n1 missing \n4.46 \nEH 0.568 \n12 PBL increases my ICT skills to \nsearch for more new knowledge \n126 \n(90%) \n12 \n(8.6%) \n2 \n(1.4%) \n4.3 \nEH 0.700 \n13 PBL increases my confidence in \nlearning \n122 \n(87.1%) \n16 \n(11.4%) \n2 \n(1.4%) \n4.22 \nEH 0.700 \n14 PBL increases my learning \nmotivation \n121 \n(86.5%) \n17 \n(12.1%) \n2 \n(1.4%) \n4.1 \nEH 0.692 \n \nWhile for the self directed learning skill, majority of the respondents (69.3%) agreed that \nPBL has also contributed to the improvement of this skill. However, there are some 30.7% \nrespondents were undecided or disagree upon this statement. This fact indicates that there are certain \nobstacles and difficulties faced by students while developing their self directed learning skill. Susana \nJill, a second year Electrical and Electronic Engineering student reflects upon some of the challenges \nshe was facing during the PBL exploration, \u201cAs a second year student, a lot of things I had learnt \nthroughout this semester. Most important thing is that I have to be more independent on doing and \ntaking every task given because it was tougher than previous semester\u2026I struggle a lot and had to \nlearnt to present in front of the class members.\u201d \n \nIn the nutshell, PBL has developed the students\u2019 confidence and motivation for learning. \nThis is so obvious as seen from the data in table 3 in which 87.1% (mean score 4.22, extremely high) \nof the respondents agreed that PBL has increased their confidence for learning and 86.5% (mean \nscore 4.10, extremely high) agreed that PBL has increased their learning motivation. This is also in \nInternational Conference on Human Capital Development (ICONHCD 2009), 25-27 May 2009, Kuantan, Pahang \nISBN 978-967-5080-51-7\u0001\n \n 7 \nline with students reflection on their learning experiences. For instance, Cheng Szi Mian, a first year \nTechnology Management student reflects, \u201cI learnt a lot of knowledge and gained experience not \nonly from the lecturer but mostly from my classmates. I enjoyed this learning process very much.\u201d \nThanagarajah s/o Ganeson, a first year Civil and Environmental Engineering student reflects on his \nlearning experience, \u201cOverall, I found out that this type of learning is fun and much more relax \ncompare to the traditional lecture. This is my first time experiencing this type of learning and \nhopefully other subjects could do the same.\u201d \n \nFinally, among the most important role of PBL is to develop the student\u2019s generic skills, the \ncritical skills required not only during the study period but more importantly after the graduation and \njoining the workforce. The data in table 4 shows that a large number of respondents agreed that PBL \nin many ways has enhanced their generic skills. 90% (mean score 4.29, extremely high) of the \nrespondents agreed that PBL has increases their communication skill.  \n \nTable 4 \nStudents\u2019 Perception on the Effectiveness of PBL in Enhancing Generic Skills \n \nNo. Statement Agree Uncertain Disagree Mean SD \n15 PBL increases my communication \nskill \n126 \n(90%) \n12 \n(8.6%) \n2 \n(1.4%) \n4.29 \nEH 0.682 \n16 PBL increases my team working \nskill \n129 \n(92.2%) \n9 \n(6.4%) \n2 \n(1.4%) \n4.34 \nEH 0.695 \n17 PBL increases the feeling of respect \nand admiration to my self and \nothers \n130 \n(92.9%) \n9 \n(6.4%) \n1 \n(0.7%) 4.32 EH 0.626 \n18 PBL increases my problem solving \nskill \n122 \n(87.2%) \n18 \n(12.9%) \n0 4.21 \nEH 0.651 \n19 PBL increases the level of my \nthinking skill \n128 \n(91.4%) \n8 \n(5.7%) \n3 \n(2.1%) \n4.32 \nEH 0.683 \n20 PBL increases my ability to manage \nand execute the given tasks  \n121 \n(86.4%) \n16 \n(11.4%) \n1 \n(0.7%) \n2 missing \n4.25 \nEH 0.681 \n21 PBL increases my creativity  121 \n(86.4%) \n18 \n(12.9%) \n0 \n1 missing \n4.23 \nEH 0.663 \n22 PBL increases my ability to manage \nthe information \n123 \n(87.8%) \n16 \n(11.4%) \n0 \n1 missing \n4.22 \nEH 0.634 \n23 PBL increases my ability to search \nfor new opportunities of learning \n123 \n(87.8%) \n16 \n(11.4%) \n1 \n(0.7%) \n4.29 \nEH 0.694 \n24 PBL increases my ability to act \nwisely \n125 \n(89.3%) \n14 \n(10%) \n1 \n(0.7%) \n4.24 \nEH 0.656 \n \nSuch of this large percentage were also recorded for other generic skills including team \nworking skill (92.2% - mean score 4.34, extremely high), ethical skills (the feeling of respect and \nadmiration to the self and others - 92.9% (mean score 4.32, extremely high), and the ability to act \nwisely \u2013 89.3% - mean score 4.24, extremely high), problem solving skill (87.2% - mean score 4.21, \nextremely high), thinking skill (91.4% - mean score 4.32, extremely high), management skill (86.4% \n- mean score 4.25, extremely high), creativity (86.4% - mean score 4.23, extremely high), \ninformation management skill (87.8% - mean score 4.22, extremely high) and  life long learning (the \nability to search for new opportunities of learning \u2013 87.8% - mean score 4.29, extremely high). \nChong En Kee, a first year Technology Management student has everything to tell us about how PBL \nmanaged to enhance his generic skills. He reflects, \u201cMoral studies had taught us to work efficiently \nin a big group. Every group member need to cooperate so that the task could be accomplished on \ntime. Beside that, we have also improved our communication skills and problem solving skill since \nwe have to communicate with each other and working hard to solve the problems arise in doing \nInternational Conference on Human Capital Development (ICONHCD 2009), 25-27 May 2009, Kuantan, Pahang \nISBN 978-967-5080-51-7\u0001\n \n 8 \ngroup work. As the task needs us to finish on time, we also develop in us the time management skill. \nMoreover, creativity and thinking skills were also learnt by most of the group members while \nparticipating in group discussion. Our group managed to work together because of the tolerance \namong each group member.\u201d \n \n \nCONCLUDING COMMENTS \n \nGenerally, the subjects taught in humanities studies are among the most critical subjects that \nshould inculcate and enhance humanistic skills among students. Unfortunately, the regular practice of \nthe traditional approach of teaching, namely the lecturing method has weakening the ability of the \nsubjects to mediate the transmission of the humanistic skills. The implementation of PBL will \nhopefully be able to open the door of great opportunities for the lecturers and teachers to adopt a \nproper change in teaching and educational methods. PBL which focuses on the process of \nexperiential learning is truly an active and constructive model of learning. This method is highly \ndemanded for today\u2019s development in students\u2019 learning styles. The students today are more \nenergetic, active and creative particularly those at the tertiary level. Such of these students need more \nappropriate learning environment so that the knowledge, skills and values can be properly mastered. \nUniversity students in Malaysia have long been exposed to the rote learning environment in which \nspoon feeding practice is rampantly practiced by the teachers at primary and secondary schools. They \nwere indeed getting more and more discouraged to have themselves entered the classroom and \nlistening to long and bored lectures. Learning humanities and social studies is more discouraged \nwhen the lecturers focus more on the classroom lectures ending up with the meaningless \nterminologies stored in students\u2019 mind. Some students may potentially possess the power of \nmemorization and he or she might be able to perform better in the examination. But the truth is that \nthe students are not in fact mastering the knowledge as it is, he or she may only mastered the \nmeaningless terminologies in which the true meaning lie outside of the classroom lectures. He or she \nwill learn the true meaning of the terminologies when going outside and face the true scenarios of the \nterminologies being taught. Thus, this needs the lecturers to change their teaching strategies so that \nthe rote learning environment can be transformed into meaningful environment. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAl-Ghazali (1983).

INTRODUCTION  \n \nThe global increase in traffic volumes has raised the need for better performing pavements. \nProper performance of bituminous pavement is guaranteed if all the pavement layers and the \nsubgrade can appropriately support traffic loads under all service conditions. Nowadays, the \nintroduction to elasticity or resilient modulus (MR) test provides an important input for \nstructural design of pavement systems by using multilayer elastic theory.  The resilient modulus \ntest is basically a repetitive load test using the stress distribution principle of indirect tensile \ntest. The resilient modulus test simulates the conditions in pavement construction materials \nunder a variety of state factor (i.e., moisture, density, gradation, bitumen content, temperature, \netc.) and stress factor (i.e., stress magnitude, stress duration, stress frequency, etc.). \n \nStress-strain deformation relationships have been established in order to examine the effect of \nstress and/or strain level on the resilient modulus found by the indirect tensile test and to define \nan approximate linear viscoelastic zone for bituminous mixtures at different temperatures.  \n \n \n \n1 Lecterur of Department of Geotechnical and Transportation Engineering, KUiTTHO \n2 Undergraduate Student of Faculty Civil and Environmental Engineering, KUiTTHO. \n \n 1\nThe KenLayer computer program can be applied only to flexible pavements with no joints or \nrigid layers.  The backbone of KenLayer is the solutions for an elastic multilayer system under a \ncircular loaded area.  The solutions are superimposed for multiple wheels, applied iteratively for \nnonlinear layers and collected at various times for under single, dual, dual-tandem or dual-\ntridem wheels with each layer behaving differently, either single or multiple.  The damage \ncaused by fatigue cracking and permanent deformation in each period over all load groups is \nsummed up to evaluate the design life. \n \n2.

The complete test reveals stability, \nflow, density, voids in total mix (VTM), voids in the mineral aggregate (VMA) and voids in \nfilled with binder (VFB).  These parameters plotted against bitumen content enable optimum to \nbe obtained for specific applications of the asphalt concrete. See the procedure of the testing in \nnext page.  \n \n\u2022 All specimens, prepared according to the JKR Standard, are immersed in a water bath  \nfor 40 minutes at 60 \u00b1 1\u02daC  \n\u2022 The testing heads and guide rods are thoroughly cleaned, guide rods lubricated and \nhead maintained at a temperature of 21.1\u02daC and 37.8\u02daC. \n 3\n\u2022 The specimen is removed from the water bath, placed in the lower jaw and   upper \njaw of the Marshall apparatus. The complete assemble is then placed in the \ncompression testing machine. The flow and load meter adjusted to zero. \n\u2022 The maximum force and flow are read and recorded. The maximum time allowed \nbetween removal of specimens from water bath and maximum load is 30s. \n\u2022 Repeat procedures with different specimens \n \n3.4 Resilient Modulus Test \n \nA 5-pulse Indirect Tensile Modulus is used in this test.  The mean, standard deviation (SD) and \ncoefficient of variance (CV %) are calculated for bitumen content and grading with different \ntemperatures.  Before test, all the specimen\u2019s diameters and heights should be measured.  The \nreading will be taken for two different positions of every sample. The procedure as below;  \n \n\u2022 Specimens should be consistent in size before loading into the indirect tensile jig. \n\u2022 Jogging control buttons are used to locate the loading actuator at the approximate \ncenter of its travel. \n\u2022 Loosely fit the specimen in the jig between the loading platens and locate the jig on \nthe base of the loading frame. \n\u2022 Measure the diameter and length of the specimen \n\u2022 Raise the yoke support cross-arms by lifting then turning the support spacers so that \neach spacer sits up on its cam ledge. \n\u2022 Place the displacement transducer yoke on the specimen and adjust the clamping \nscrews so that the specimen sits centrally within the yoke. Tighten the knurled \nlocking nuts on the clamps at one end of the specimen and slightly loosen the \nclamps at the other end. \n\u2022 Place the specimen and yoke on the lower loading platen with the yoke supported \nby the cross arms. Locate the top loading platen on the jig and lower it onto the \nspecimen. \n\u2022 Lower the loading shaft to locate the ball end in the tapered hole of the platen. \n\u2022 Position the yoke so that the specimen is laterally central and tighten the two loose \nclamps to firmly attach the yoke to the specimen. \n\u2022 Lower the yoke support cross arms by rotating each spacer until it drops down from \nthe cam ledge. \n\u2022 Adjust the levels of the LVDTs on two sides to ensure that both are working  \n             within their calibrated range. \n\u2022 Run the computer-aided test and record the final results computed  \n \n4.

This \noccurs when decreases of aggregates content in the mixture.  Besides, a temperature also gave \nan effect to the design life.  The temperature at 25\u02daC gave the higher value to the design life \ncompared at 35\u02daC.  This scenario occurs due to softening of asphalt binder at higher \ntemperature and caused the lower of pavement strength.  Therefore, the design life at higher \ntemperature is lower. In term of an angle of resilient modulus which is also called elastic \nmodulus, it was obviously shows that more value of resilient modulus (MR) gave more value of \ndesign life.  This scenario occurred to all mixtures. The unit of resilient modulus from every \nmix had been converted from Mega Pascal (Mpa) to pounds per square inch (psi). \n \n \n \nChart of Design Life For ACW 14, ACW 20 \nand ACB 28\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nACW 14 ACW 20 ACB 28\nMix Type\nDe\nsi\ngn\n L\nife\nDesign Life (25\u02daC) Design Life (35\u02daC)\nMix Type \nDesign \nLife \nDesign \nLife \n  (25\u02daC) (35\u02daC) \nACW 14 39.79 23.53 \nACW 20 40.78 27.2 \nACB 28 72.72 52.56 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 5.

The value of \nresilient modulus higher for this temperature and caused the design life for this graph higher \nthan 35\u02daC. \n 7\nThe output run of KenLayer also shows that the design life was controlled by permanent \ndeformation.  The multiple axles were analyzed twice.  The first determination was the primary \ndamage ratio by considering all axles and then determined the additional damage ratio by \nplacing the response point halfway between two axles.   \n \n5. CONCLUSION \n \nBased on the research that has been carried out, it can be concluded that this research is \nsuccessful.  The effect of state factor which is bitumen content, grading and also temperature is \nfinally identified.   \n \nThe bitumen content increased when the MR value decreased which means the strength of the \nspecimens was reduced with the increasing of bitumen content.  In an angle of grading, the \nconclusion is the bigger type of mix that has been used; hence the higher of MR value was \nobtained.   \n \nAnother factor that has been considered was temperature.  The lower temperature gave higher \nvalue of MR.  This is due to softening of asphalt binder in higher temperature.  \n \nThus, it is proven that the increasing of resilient modulus in this research gave a higher value \nfor design life.  It also obtained proven in KenLayer software.  It can happen also due to the \ngrading processes of mix design.  Higher grading gave the higher value of resilient modulus \n(MR) and further to design life which also gave the higher value in year\u2019s unit. \n \n6. RECOMMENDATION \n \nAs a recommendation, the mix of ACB28 gave highest strength compared to ACW 20 and \nACW 14. Moreover, ACW 20 should be used in real and costly highway construction besides it \nis more economically and prepare stiffer pavement.  \n \nFor further research, adding some waste material such as glass, polymer, rubber seed and others \ninto ACB 28 is welcome to compare the effect of state factor on bituminous mixture of resilient \nmodulus.  If the mixes gives good result, it mean can be applied in our road construction. \n \nBesides, the Circly software also can be used to replace the KenLayer software which can be \nused to determine the lifetime of pavement, vertical displacements and others. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \n \nThe authors would like to thank the Kolej Universiti Teknologi Tun Hussein Onn, Batu Pahat, \nJohor for funding this work, especially facilities of Highway Engineering Laboratory, Jabatan \nKerja Raya, and IKRAM, Kuala Lumpur for delivering some valuable information and \nknowledge. \n \nREFERENCES \n \nFritz, H.W., Eustacchio, E.

Population and economic growth, urbanisation and increased technologp \nhave transformed many A-Ialaysian river systems from water industries into non water industries. Due to \nthese changes, the function of the riverfront areas have also changed and the current pattern of riverfront \ndevelopment in ~Malaysia now focus more on mixed-use development and recreation. Present% numbers of \nriverfront a!evelopment projects were developed in Malaysia for recreation, residential, and mixed- use^ \nUnforttmately, in most cases, the developments identified are not snccess$~l whereby, having cost effects \nmore than economic value. For example. increases in water pollution indexes and rates of j~rvenile \nproblems. The focus of this study was to examine waterfront development in ~Malaysia as well as to identzb \nthe attributes of waterfront development, in order to develop guidelines for ivate<fvont development. The \nfindings of this research were based on interviews conducted with Government officers, Property \ndevelopers, and the Waterfront community from three case study areas (qzlalitative phase), and from \nquestionnaires mailed and e-mailed to property development companies listed tmder R~rrsa ~Malaysia \n(quantitative phase). The findings identified 18 attributes to be used in assisting developers when \nundertaking waterfront projects in the future The atbzbutes identified were then recommended to be used \nas guidelines ofbest practices of riverfront development in iWalaysia. \nKeywords: Waterfront, Waterfront Development, Riverfront Development, Riverfront \nDevelopment guidelines \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal of Techno-Social I ISSN 2229-8940 1 Vol. 4 No. 1 June 2012 \n- ~ - ~ ~ \n* Factor loadings in the range of i .30 to 1 .40 are considered to meet the minimal level for interpretation of \nstructure. Loadings i .50 or greater are considered practically significant, and loadings exceeding i .70 are \nindicative of well defined structure (Hair, et al., 2006). \nCONCLUSION \nThis paper examined the waterfront development practices in Malaysia and, the principles that \nimportant for sustainable waterfront development in Malaysia. From the results, it can be  \nconcluded that only a small number of property development companies had undertaken \nwaterfront development projects in Malaysia, even though they had more than 10 years \nexperience in property developments and employed sufficient numbers of staff. Moreover, \nalthough the results showed that only a small number of property development companies have \nundertaken waterfront development projects, however, the number of waterfront development \nprojects in Malaysia is forecasted to increase in the future. These reasons are supported by the \nliterature that indicate that the growing number of waterfront development and redevelopment \nprojects throughout the world are attributed to several factors such as environmental awareness \nand smart growth, preservation and adaptive reuse, recreation, increased tourism and enhanced \nfederal assistance (Gaffen, 2004; Tumbde, 2005). A n  increasing demand for recreational activities \nand a number of other factors have become determinants in the redevelopment process and \nwaterfronts have been mostly designed as new public open spaces of cities that are totally \ndifferent from their former structures (Butuner, 2006; Tsukio, 1984). T o  secure long-term growth \nof the waterfront resource, it is important for waterfront areas to be used strategically to  maintain \nits economic value and enhance its specific features or image. Therefore, inclusion all of the \nprinciples (as presented in Table 8) in the planning for waterfront development for Malaysia is \nappropriate. Thus, apparently, the harmonies of waterfront development could be achieved \nthrough combinations of people, nature and technology (Mann, 1973). Further, it was considered \nthat these principles should be  used with modification to suit the current regulations and \nguidelines for the control of  waterfront developments in Malaysia. \nREFERENCES \nAbidin, R.

IntroductionCurrently, helical milling is positioned as a good alternative to conventional drilling. In fact,the aerospace industry characterized by being at the forefront of technology seems to have foundin this strategy an ally to improve the performance of drilling operations. This fact is reflected inresearch programs such as \u201cClean Sky\u201d founded by the European Union for Horizon 2020, whoseobjectives include the development of innovative technologies to reduce the environmental impact ofair transport and improve the sustainability of current manufacturing processes, being of great interestfor this machining strategy [1,2].In this context, the aerospace industry faces the challenge of digitizing production processes infactories using sensors and information systems to transform production processes and make themmore efficient. The challenge of achieving industry 4.0 must include the added difficulty of the highqualities required of the elements and the use of difficult-to-machine material. This highlights thetitanium alloy UNS R56400 commonly called Ti6Al4V, which due to its excellent relationship betweenmechanical properties/weight, and corrosion resistance stands out from other materials.Many drilling techniques uses of cutting fluids to minimize the generations of typical hole defect,especially in this material. Cutting fluids have benefits such as lubrication and cooling of the machiningprocess, reducing the coefficient of friction between the tool and the workpiece, and between thetool and the evacuated chip. In addition, they favour the evacuation of the heat in the cutting area,which contributes to removal of the generated chip and improves the tool life. However, the use ofmineral-based cutting fluids, require special treatment once they have been used to eliminate the toxiccomponent and comply with environmental legislation [3]. The use of cutting fluid can reach a costAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 845; doi:10.3390/app10030845 www.mdpi.com/journal/applsciAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 845 2 of 18overrun of 16% to the machining process [4]. For this reason, there is a worldline tendency to minimizeor eliminate the use of traditional cutting fluid in machining operations, betting on techniques morecommitted to the environment. The current trend is to use dry or near-dry machining techniques forgreen manufacturing [5\u20137].The use of helical milling to obtain holes brings many advantages that were discussed in R.Pereira\u2019s review [8]. These include the flexibility that kinematics brings to the process, more efficientlychip removal, the use of external cooling, and the forces developed during machining in the axial axisare lower compared to conventional drilling, a relevant factor in the formation of burrs in metal alloysand delamination in composite materials [9,10].Different researchers have addressed a large part of the typical defectology of the hole associatedwith this process. For example, D. Olvera compares two helical milling strategies and one drillingstrategy, concluding that the best precision is obtained with helical although the diameters are alwayslower due to the flexibility of the tool; however, he does not find significant improvements in termsof surface quality [11]. D.Sun compares conventional drilling with helical milling and concludesthat helical milling improves surface quality and fatigue resistance [12]. H. Wang studied the helicalmilling of Ti/CFRP stacks, finding an oversizing of the hole in CFRP and a reduction in the case oftitanium [13]. Hao Li observe the tool wear and its impact on the quality of the holes, finding a highquality of the holes until the end of the tool life; however, the frontal wear has a great impact onthe burr exit [14]. On the other hand, Q. Zhao compares conventional drilling and helical milling,studying tool wear and concluding that the tool\u2019s life in helical milling is longer than in conventionaldrilling. In addition, it is found that helical milling produces compressive residual stresses [15].G. Urbicain compares conventional drilling with two other strategies (helical milling and contouringmilling), obtaining greater diameter accuracy, less angular deviation and burr-free deviation in helicalmilling [16].

Brinksmeier [17] performs a mathematical decomposition of the movement carried outto facilitate its study, relating the material that is milled and the material drilled during an operationaccording to two independent parameters (hole and tool diameter), and defining a new \u201cG\u201d parameter,as the quotient between milled material and drilled, deducing that this ratio is independent of the axialvelocity, as verified in Equation (1):G =V1V2=\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8edD2B \u2212D2wD2W\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 (1)where V1 and V2 are the volumes of milled and drilled material respectively, DB is the diameter ofthe hole and Dw is the diameter of the tool. Another work found that for aluminium alloy, downmilling and the use of MQL (minimum quantity of lubricant) produces higher burrs than in up and drymilling [9]. X.D. Qin makes a comparison between conventional drilling and helical milling, concludingthat the cutting forces in helical milling are about 1/5 of the forces in drilling, tool wear is improved,and all machining precision indicators are better in helical milling, especially burr formation [18].On the other hand, the properties shown by these elements when in service are influenced by themachining processes used, due to the impact on the surface integrity of the components. The conceptof surface integrity includes both exterior and internal defects. The first can be microdefects wherethe concepts of surface quality and waviness are included, or macrodefects that include the conceptsof shape. The internal defects are located in the sub-surface producing alterations that includemicrostructural transformations, heat-affected areas, hardness, residual stresses etc. [19\u201321]. In thesetypes of component, fatigue strength is one of the most important properties, and where residualstresses have an important role.The effect of the helical milling strategy on the residual stresses and fatigue life of the machinedpart has always conditioned the choice of more traditional methods. However, several studies haveshown that the influence of the helical milling process on the generation of residual stresses can bebeneficial by inducing so-called \u201cgood\u201d stresses (compressive residual stresses) and lead to improvedAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 845 3 of 18performance in fatigue tests. Dan Sun et al. in their investigations [12,22] compared among othercharacteristics, the residual stresses and fatigue life generated by conventional drilling and helicalmilling processes. These studies concluded that the elements machined with helical milling showeda longer fatigue life, causing, among other factors, the induced stresses to be compressive stresses.On the other hand, Ruihu Zhou et al. in their study [23], carried out an analytical model to predictthe residual stresses induced by helical milling, finding a good relationship between the theoreticalmodels and the experimental results, and compression stresses were obtained in all cases.In this context, and recognizing the importance of the drilling process before assembly operations,helical milling is positioned as an alternative to conventional drilling where potentially advantageouscharacteristics are identified. However, the correlation between the variables associated with holequality and the parameters associated with kinematics for difficult-to-machine materials has rarelybeen studied.Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify the sensitivity and the main trends of theproperties that define the quality of the holes in relation to the kinematic parameters of the helicalmilling process in the UNS R56400 alloy. During the study, a lack of consensus was detected amongthe different researchers over identifying the source of problems that generate ambiguity in theinterpretation of the kinematic parameters of the helical milling process. This is due to the variabilityof ways to define these parameters, the units used and the different nomenclatures, which generate animportant focus of problems when approaching the study, understanding, choice and definition ofparameters, and application of calculations. This makes it difficult and even prevents in many casescomparability between different studies and the reproducibility of the tests. Therefore, at the sametime it is proposed to establish a common nomenclature to avoid the ambiguities and difficulties thatarise in this regard (Table 1).Table 1.

In helical milling, the holesare obtained through the combination of the rotation movement of the tool together with its translationalong a helical trajectory (feed rate). At the same time, the movement of the tool on the helical trajectoryis a relative movement between the tool and the part that can decompose into a circular movement onthe work plane and an axial movement perpendicular to it (generating the tangential and axial feedrate) (Figure 1).Appl.

However, providing theunits in mm/tooth referring to tangential velocity without alluding to or identifying this differencebetween velocities or without providing additional data, may allow a misinterpretation.Other investigations define this parameter as orbital rotation speed, expressed in millimetres perminute, understood as a speed of the centre of the tool on the helical path.Finally, Lan Zhou proposes and defines a parameter that represents the ratio between spindlespeed and orbital revolutions [28].Table 2.

The choice of mm\u00b7min\u22121 willprovide more convenient information for studies related to process performance (material remove rate).However, conclusions cannot be extrapolated to cases where this parameter is measured in mm\u00b7tooth\u22121because combining the different tangential feed rates with the cutting speeds generates a different feedper tooth in each case. On the other hand, if this parameter is defined as mm/tooth, we obtain differentinformation about the process, which can easily be related to chip thickness and what it involves.Thirdly, axial feed rate also can present difficulties of interpretation related to units. Tables 3\u20135show in blue the values provided in the papers, in orange the values are calculated, and it highlightsthose that are not reproducible.The tool manufacturers consulted express this data in an angle defined in degrees (\u03b1), as definedby D. Olvera et al. in their work [11]. However, there are many other ways of defining and expressingthis parameter, an important number of articles consulted express this parameter in millimetres perrevolution, where it must be assumed that reference is made to the revolutions of the tool (spindle), notto the revolutions on the orbital trajectory. In other research this data is also given in millimetres perrevolution, with the clarification that it is about millimetres per orbital revolution (also defined as theAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 845 6 of 18pitch of the helix) being essential, and finding again a focus of possible errors of interpretation whenthe same parameter can be defined with the same units by interpreting them in two different ways.Finally, it can also be found expressed in millimetres per tooth, as indicated by D. Nespor in [30].Table 3. Values provided in the publication consulted for axial movement in millimetre per toolrevolution and millimetre per tooth.Ref.

All this shows the complexity of the process and shows the deep knowledge needed to achieve the objectives pursued. Also, it must be borne in mind that the paths must be programmed in CNC (Computer numerical control) machining and the way the kinematics information must be entered must be taken into account. Also, the difficulty of making comparisons between different studies is reflected, and it is shown that the conclusions obtained depend on the choice and definition of parameters, being only applicable for that configuration. In addition, the absence of information may impede the reproducibility of the tests. Finally, an experimental design has been carried out to identify and evaluate the sensitivity and main trends of the hole quality indicators with the kinematic variables of the process. 2. Materials and Methods The high number of variables to be studied entails a high number of tests and resource consumption. Therefore, it has been decided to opt for a two-level fractional factorial experimental design. In this design a complete factorial design subset is used, allowing a reduction in the resources employed. This experimental design is selected on the assumption that higher order effects are negligible in order to obtain information on the main effects and lower order iterations. The structure of the fractional factorial design is as shown through the Table 6: Table 6. Fractional factorial design.

In this case, no main effects form alias structure with any other main effect or two factor interactions, but some two factor interactions form alias structures with others two factor interactions and the main effects form alias structures with 3-factor interactions.

Surface QualitySurface quality has been evaluated through the arithmetic mean roughness parameter (Ra) becauseit is the parameter used by the aerospace sector, generally with Ra below than 1.6 \u00b5m [36].The value used for the analysis is the average of two measurements taken in each hole. Figure 8shows the values obtained in the three repetitions of each combination of parameters. It shows a visualdifferentiation between the up-milling and down-milling tests.In spite of the observed wear, the repeatability of the tests is high, with the largest deviation beingfound in test 5 with a standard deviation value of 0.30 \u00b5m.The values obtained are within the ranges observed in other investigations, for example [14]found roughness between 0.4 and 0.8 \u00b5m, relating this increase with the tool wear and reaching amaximum of 0.96 \u00b5m when tool failure. Some research corroborates that the results in helical millingare better than those obtained in conventional drilling obtaining an average of 0.61 \u00b5m in [11], andvalues between 0.2 and 0.7 in [22,32], nevertheless Zhao in [15] found better results in conventionaldrilling.

The trends are not exactly the same as the results obtained in [32], where they coincide in the trend in the tangential feed rate but not in the axial feed rate. In both, an increase in parameters leads to an increase in roughness. On the other hand, an influence of cutting speed in the case of dry machining was observed associated with the adhesion caused by high temperature; nevertheless in the present study this parameter presents the least influence on roughness. This effect was already known in peripheral milling, and in helical milling it is shown to have a very similar behaviour. Therefore, the fact that better qualities appear in down milling may be due to the same reasons, among which are that no burnishing or reworking of the chips appears. Table 10 shows the results of the P value and F value for the test parameters. Observing the data shows that both the strategy, tangential advance and the combination of two parameters are below 0.05 (95% confidence level), with the direction of rotation being the most evident next to a higher f-value (indicating its significance). The strategy is the most relevant factors in the variation of Ra, obtaining a p-value = 0.000, lower than the level of significance (\u03b1 = 0.05). In addition, f-value is greater than the rest of the parameters (f = 68.15), confirming once again the importance of the direction of rotation in Ra during the helical milling process. Table 9.

Diameter The value used for the diameter analysis was the average of the values obtained in the two measurements of each hole. Figure 11 shows the values obtained in the three repetitions of the tests for each combination of parameters. As in the roughness, there is little variation between test repetitions, with the largest deviation found in test 2, with a standard deviation of 8 \u00b5m. It can be seen that depending on the parameters used we can find deviations above and below the programmed diameter. However, other researchers only find deviations in one of the senses. It was found by [18] that all deviations are above the desired diameter, but on the contrary [11,14,28] obtained lower values than those programmed. In all cases, good accuracy is attributed to the process, with values between IT6-IT11 according to ISO 286-1:2010.

In spite of this, the terms\u2019cutting speed and angential advance are the closest and have a greater f value, being reflected in theslope of the effect\u2019s graphs.Appl.

Kinetics has been defined from differentstudies, proposing a unique nomenclature to unify and standardize the process parameters and itsunits. This step would allow the comparison of different works.On the other hand, it has been possible to develop an experimental design with a reduced numberof combinations. The results show the main trends of the hole quality indicators against the kinematicvariables of the helical milling process.The results have shown the sensitivity of the quality indicators of the hole. The helical millingconditions that have most affected the roughness of the machined surface have been milling direction(strategy) and to a lesser extent the tangential feed rate per tooth (fzt). The lowest roughness values arefound with down milling and an increase in the tangential feed rate per tooth.Values above and below the programmed value have been found. It has been possible to observethe influence that the feed-rate parameters (axial and tangential) have on the diameter of the hole,which may be strongly related to the cutting forces.The burr formation is the most unstable defect, and from which it has not been possible toobtain sufficient evidence to affirm the influence of the kinematic parameters, which may be due touncontrolled factors such as temperature or tool wear.Author Contributions: F.J.P.-M. and S.R.F.-V. developed drilling tests and data treatment.

Introduction  The family-owned nature of the firm influences the processes of innovation (De Massis, Frattini and Lichtenthaler, 2013). Regarding the innovative orientation of family firms, there are two different streams in the literature. On one hand, family firms are developed from the entrepreneurial spirit of the founder, trying to maintain this entrepreneurial impulse across generations (Casillas, Moreno, and Barbero, 2011; Eddleston, Kellermanns, and Zellweger, 2012; Zellweger, Nason, and Nordqvist, 2012). On the other hand, some authors argue that family firms are not willing to afford risks and become more conservative along the time (Naldi et al., 2007; Zahra, 2005). De Massis, Kotlar, Chua and Chrisman (2014) point that there is no clear evidence about the innovative behavior of family firms. Previous research offers mixed results that can be explained by measurement  ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES ISSN 2345-0282 (online) http://jssidoi.org/jesi/ 2020 Volume 7 Number 3 (March) http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2020.7.3(20)  1741  factors (Rutherford, Kuratko and Holt, 2008), or by means of missing mediators or moderators behavior (De Massis, Chirico, Kotlar and Naldi, 2014).  Proactiveness is an important feature of family firms\u2019 innovative behavior, as well as a key source of sustained growth and performance for family firms (Casillas, Moreno and Barbero, 2010). Entrepreneurial spirit within family businesses may be crucial because its main goal is to identify and gain opportunities, in the dynamic and uncertain competitive environment (Sirmon and Hitt, 2003). Family firms have to face the challenge of surviving in the long run while, maintaining their distinctive features and the innovation can be a way to achieve the goals of family firms. According to Aronoff (1998) family businesses, which feature a long tradition of entrepreneurship, have an advantage in the transition over time.   Innovation is constantly improving: new techniques and methods appear and every day more qualified personnel involved. Innovation processes can start with the recognition of entrepreneurial opportunities, followed by the entrepreneurial actions of exploration and exploitation of the entrepreneurial opportunity. Following Goel and Jones (2016) the firm can opt for two actions, or a combination of them \u2013ambidexterity-, to deal with entrepreneurial opportunities. Ambidexterity changes over time in family firms, so it is so important to consider the temporal dimension in the research of family firms (Sharma, Salvato, and Reay, 2014).   According to Zellweger and Sieger (2012), the proactive attitude of family firms may change over time, so it can be expected differences in the innovative behavior in family firms over time. But, how about non-family firms? Can be expected differences in the innovative behavior among family firms and non-family firms over time? Do they evolve following different paths over time? Maybe age of the firm the main a determinant factor of the evolution of its innovative behavior? Are other factors such as sustainability the reasons of this behavior, or it could be determined by their family or non-family nature? We try to shed some light about these research questions in our study.  The above arguments show a relevant aspect, which presents a lack of research about it. Despite some previous works (Zellweger and Sieger, 2012; De Massis et al. 2014a), the temporary dimension and its influence on the innovate behaviour in family firms is a topic that remains understudied. Therefore the aim of this paper is to analyze the effect of time on the innovation behaviour of the business, and the study of the different effects of it on family firms and non-family firms. To do so, we focus on the different stages of firms, distinguishing between first and later generations of family firms, so considering a temporal distinction for non-family firms. This is useful for the study of family companies, as stated Rau, Werner & Schell, 2018. In addition, the effects on the innovative behavior of companies both of age and of generation in control are analyzed. It contributes to the development of knowledge about family businesses (N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Cacho & Grande, 2013, 2012) After this first introductory section, the theoretical framework and hypothesis are addressed. Then, the methodology used and the results of the study are presented, and it ends with the discussion and conclusions. 2. Theoretical framework and hypotheses  2.1 Innovation and family businesses In order to address the research questions about the influence of time on the innovative behavior of the firms, we draw on both agency theory and stewardship theory. According to De Massis et al. (2014a), innovative behavior in family firms can be explained from both an agency and stewardship perspectives. Previous works have focused on the overlapping field that is common to entrepreneurship and family business (Habbershon and Pistrui, 2002; Aldrich and Cliff, 2003; Rogoff, Kay and Heck, 2003; Anderson, Jack and Dodd, 2005; Nordqvist and Melin, 2010) to analyse the entrepreneurial features of family firms that can foster the innovation (Lorenzo and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Cacho, 2012).  ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES ISSN 2345-0282 (online) http://jssidoi.org/jesi/ 2020 Volume 7 Number 3 (March) http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2020.7.3(20)  1742   In addition, Corbetta and Salvato (2004) suggested that the innovative behavior depends on the agency-oriented or the stewardship-oriented behaviors between family members and firm managers and owners, that in turn, depends on the nature of family dynamics. These behaviors can evolve over time, from a more stewardship-oriented trend at the early stages of development of the firm, to a more agency orientation in the following stages of life cycle (De Massis, et al. 2014a). The study of the family business has been supported by very diverse theories, which have generally been \"borrowed and not returned\" to other sister disciplines. Therefore, as we have seen in previous sections, when we reflect on the theoretical framework for the study of family businesses, we find a broad group of theories, many of them complementary to each other (agency-stewardship; agency-resources and capabilities; resources and capabilities-systems etc.) and mostly from the field of organization, psychology, economics and law. Besides, an experience such as succession in the company is rooted in the company's culture (Rau el al. 2018) can condition innovation. Stewardship theory approaches can improve innovation in family businesses and not in family businesses (Neubaum, Thomas, Dibrell and Craig, 2017).  The literature of family businesses takes into consideration two different perspectives (Casillas et al., 2011; Chirico, Sirmon, Sciascia and Mazzola, 2011). On one hand, some authors suggest that family firms feature unique conditions to develop an entrepreneurial path (N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Cacho et al. 2018).  On the other hand, other papers point to a more conservative and risk averse profile of family firms (Zahra, 2005; Naldi, Nordqvist, Sj\u00f6berg and Wiklund, 2007). There are mixed results about the entrepreneurial or conservative nature of family firms, remaining unanswered the question about the real orientation of family firms towards innovation. Chirico et al. (2011) suggest that it is possible that neither of these two perspectives is fully correct. Perhaps it can be owed to the multiple differences among family firms in terms of openness to change, degree of generational involvement and participation of family members or family employees in the formulation of the strategy. Therefore, the research on innovation in family businesses is inconclusive, although of crucial relevance because of the strong influence of innovation on the firm\u2019s performance, growth, and survival (Beck et al., 2011).  2.2 Time and Innovation Within this research domain, entrepreneurial orientation (EO) has become a well-established construct (Nordqvist and Melin, 2010; Zellweger and Sieger, 2012). EO is referred to \u201cthe need for organisations to develop and orientation that allows their individuals and teams to engage in entrepreneurial strategy making\u201d (Nordqvist and Melin, 2010; p. 226), explained by Chirico et al. (2011) as the tendency toward product innovation, proactiveness and risk-taking behaviors.  There are considerations of the time and innovation in the family firms proposed in the literature. Thus, regarding the models that proposed that the family effect has a dual effect that is different for input versus output (Matzler et al., 2015; Lichtenthaler and Muethel, 2012), we could observe the temporality in these kind of studies, they analyse firstly input (initial stage) and after output (final stage). Besides, the models of Duran, Kammerlander, van Essen and Zellweger (2014) and Cucculelli, Le Breton-Miller and Miller (2016) explained that the different behaviour of family firms on innovation was caused by a temporary aspect: The generation in charge. On the other hand, Konig, et al. (2013) stated that family influence is related with the speed of discontinuous technology adoption that is an accumulated function conditioned by three aspects. Firstly, by the time that incumbents take to recognize the innovation as a relevant strategic issue that requires a response (Kaplan et al., 2003), secondly by the time that incumbents decide to adopt the discontinuous technology (Christensen, 1997), and thirdly by the time that incumbents implement the adoption decision by launching a first product based on the new technology (Lieberman & Montgomery, 1988). Because the respective duration of each of these three adoption phases (Thomas et al., 1993) is not equally affected by each adoption barrier, we discuss the impact of family influence on each of the phases separately. Finally, Carnes et al. (2017) also explain the importance effect of time, highlighting that to innovate is a challenging yet necessary activity for firms throughout their life-cycle to maintain growth over time (Hess, 2007; Hitt et al., 2006).   ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES ISSN 2345-0282 (online) http://jssidoi.org/jesi/ 2020 Volume 7 Number 3 (March) http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2020.7.3(20)  1743  The EO can be stated to capture a firm's entrepreneurial behavior through innovation, proactivity and risk-taking (Basco et al. 2019). Product innovation refers to the launching of new products to attend the needs of current or future costumers, by using creativity; proactiveness is related to with anticipation in the markets; and risk-taking behavior reflects an entrepreneurial orientation facing decisions that involve a relevant bet for the firm. These three original dimensions of EO have been extended by Lumpkin and Dess (1996), who added autonomy and competitive aggressiveness. Autonomy concerns to the independent action of an individual or a team in bringing forth an idea or a vision and carrying it through to completion (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996), whereas competitive aggresiveness is referred to a firm\u2019s propensity to challenge its competitors (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996; Zellweger and Sieger, 2012). De Massis, Chirico, Kotlar and Naldi (2014) focus on proactiveness, as a relevant trait of entrepreneurial behavior in family firms and a crucial source for growth (Casillas, et al., 2010), to analyze its relationship with firm age. They conclude that proactiveness in family firms first declines, then increases, and finally decreases over time.   The time has been considered in studies of FBs analyzing the generation in control, this is the generation that has the control over the management of the family firm (Bammens, Voordeckers, & Van Gils, 2008; Cruz & Nordqvist, 2010). Beck et al. (2011) analyzed the influence of the generation in control on innovation in family firms, previously studied also by Litz & Kleysen (2001), Lorenzo-G\u00f3mez & N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Cacho, (2012) and Zahra (2005) and conclude that this relationship is mediated by market orientation. Therefore, the role of the generation in control need to be taken into consideration, because introduces heterogeneity into family firms (Kellermanns & Eddleston, 2006; Kellermanns et al., 2008). This heterogeneity is derived from the evolving features of the family firm\u2019s management and structure as the company passes on from one generation to the next (Lansberg, 1999).   Regarding to the differences between family firms of first-generation and later-generation, they were previously studied by Rau et al. (2018). These authors highlighted that the differences between generations include features such as decision-making structure, professionalization degree, attitude against risk, external orientation and orientation towards growth (Beck et al., 2011). The decision-making processes are dependent on the dispersion extent of managerial control among family members (De Massis et al., 2014a). The decision-making structure is more centralized and the level of professionalization is usually lower in first-generation family firms rather than later-generation family firms, as a consequence of the strong influence of the founder in the early periods of the company (Cruz & Nordqvist, 2010; Dyer, 1988). Besides, Zahra, Hayton and Salvato (2004) analyzed risk aversion in family firms, concluding that later generation family firms are more averse to risk than first generation family firms. In addition of it, later generation family firms present a more external orientation than early step family firms that are more internally focused (Cruz & Nordqvist, 2007). Finally, later-generation family firms are more oriented to growth (Kellermanns & Eddleston, 2006), because of the need for growth to ensure the survival of the firm (McConaughy and Philips, 1999). Thus, family firms need to maintain and enhance their innovation capabilities in order to ensure the trans-generational survival of the firm (Beck et al., 2011).   Other justification to these differences in the research is highlighted by Duran et al. (2016) stated that the difference on results on innovation output in family firms with later generation as opposed to first-generation CEOs, arguing that those dynamic capabilities cannot be acquired at short-term, because they need to be built up over an extended period of time. So, innovation processes are conditioned by the time, because it is the only way to acquire dynamic capabilities (Teece, Pisano and Shuen, 1997). As such, the authors also draw attention to the temporal perspective of firms\u2019 competitive advantages with regard to innovation, which might cumulate over time.  In addition to this, Werner, Schr\u00f6der and Chlosta (2017) argue that the companies are conditioned by the time that they spend in the integration in the environment (Aldrich and Cliff, 2003; Bird and Wennberg, 2014). The enduring occupation of the family owner leads to networks of trust with clients and suppliers as potential partners  ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES ISSN 2345-0282 (online) http://jssidoi.org/jesi/ 2020 Volume 7 Number 3 (March) http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2020.7.3(20)  1744  in R & D cooperation (Habbershon and Williams, 1999). Trusted cooperation along the value chain illustrates the strong networks of SMEs, specifically traditional and old family businesses (Llach and Nordqvist, 2010).  Following Schumpeter (1934), it could be said that innovation is influenced by the way in which a firm manages its resources over time and develops its capabilities. In family firms, the management and structure of the firm of resources and capabilities is performed by the generation in control (Lansberg, 1999), that in turn influences on the innovation of the firm (Beck et al., 2011).  Hypotheses  The specific characteristics of family businesses can contribute to the maintenance of their entrepreneurial orientation over time. Thus, Zahra (2005) points that family firms present a more innovation-oriented culture when the later generations are involved at the helm of the firm. If we consider that family businesses management is transferred from generation to generation, by means of renewal processes that imply a broad tenure which can be extended for a generation -about 25-30 years-, family businesses can respond in a better way to the challenge of reinventing themselves that companies which just have to face this matter from time to time. The replacement of a person in charge of the family business management, which is usually at the end of his professional life, by a person of the next generation, implies a renewal in the direction, changing an elder person for someone younger, with most of his/her professional life ahead. Next generations are often characterized as the drivers behind innovation as well as the identifiers of entrepreneurial opportunities, in searching of new ways of doing things (Beck et al., 2011). The lower demand for results of the family business, characterized by shareholders committed to the long term, what has been called patient capital, facilitates this process of transition between generations, and allows new family members in charge to develop their own way of managing, and at the same time the renewal of the business model and keeping the company in the hands of the family. Because of the changing environmental conditions, next generations have to develop a more external orientation (Cruz & Nordqvist, 2010). Other example is Rau et al (2018), highlighting that with a growing number of generation, innovation output in family firms continuously decrease. It could be asked if can be expected differences between generations in terms of attitude towards innovation. The founder, in the first generation, is an entrepreneur who sets up a business idea that over time and with his effort can lead to the consolidation of his/her company. In this early step, the concentrated decision-making authority of the founder (Dyer, 1988), may lead to a negative influence on innovation (Beck et al., 2011).  The next generation can inherit a consolidated company, with a business model that has worked properly during a long period, which could coincide with the founder's tenure. However, after a few years, the initial idea will need a renewal to maintain the competitive pulse of the company. On the other hand, the next generation does not have to be a clone of the founder and possibly have their own ideas to reorient the business model of the company. The participative involvement of family members in decision making, in the second or upper generation family firm facilitates innovation (Aronoff, 1998). In addition, the succeeding generations usually receive a higher level of education compared to their predecessors. This greater and better training, regarding to not only the academic field, but also the external work experience in other companies, that they have received as part of the training of successors, could provide the necessary ideas for the renewal of the business model. Also, second or more generation family firms tend to be more professionalized than first-generation family firms (Dyer, 1988).  The sharing of decision making, the higher degree of professionalization, and the higher level of training lead to a higher level of innovation in later-generation family firms. Beck et al. (2011; 256) indicate that \u201clater-generation family firms must rejuvenate, recreate, and reinvent themselves if they want to sustain the same level of growth and financial inheritance of the previous generation\u201d. In a similar way, Kellermanns et al. (2008) highlight the  ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES ISSN 2345-0282 (online) http://jssidoi.org/jesi/ 2020 Volume 7 Number 3 (March) http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2020.7.3(20)  1745  priority on business growth that later-generation family firms must foster in order to ensure the survival of the firm. As a consequence, growth and survival are crucial goals for family firms as a means to allow the transition to the next generations (Kellermanns et al., 2008; Beck et al., 2011) that lead to the reinforcement of innovation. In this sense, it could be considered that family businesses feature a greater innovative character, both in their beginnings, which can be comparatively similar to those of non-family companies, and in the continuity over the succeeding generations. The need for innovation can be favored by the renewal of leaders at the head of the company, that come from a different generation, by replacing older people with younger people, which may hold better training. One might wonder whether differences in the innovative nature of the company in different generations should be expected. So that, is the family business in the first generation more innovative by the creative impulse of the founder? Or, on the contrary, is it more innovative in the following generations, thanks to the renewing impulse provided by the successors? And if so, could it be considered more innovative the family businesses than non-family ones, which go through renovation processes in a different direction and ownership? Relief in the management of non-family companies occurs more frequently than in the case of family businesses, whose tenures tend to be more extended over time. That is, family managers may have more possibilities to develop their ideas, more time and a more appropriate context to implement them, because of the family support and non-dependence on short-term results. Possibly managers of non-family companies are more afraid of risking their managerial position by experimenting new business options. This situation may be repeated over time, since the demand for short-term results may not allow to set long-term stable objectives, and ultimately the renewal of the business model on a basis strong enough to build competitive advantages in the long term. In addition of it, the passage of time puts at risk the survival of the company, which will only succeed if it is able to renew itself and maintain its competitive capacity over time (Beck et al., 2011). In this way, it can be considered that seniority influences its innovative capacity, so we can expect differences between younger and longer-lived companies in this regard. Family firm, due to a mix of long-term orientation, unique resources and capabilities through the interaction of family and business systems makes their behavior different from that of a non-family business throughout their product / market cycle life (Sharma and Salvato, 2011). Patel and Fiet (2011) point that family firms can take advantage of the accumulation of knowledge assets and networks along their trajectories, in order to discovering and exploiting business opportunities. They argue that this kind of family specific resources allow family firms to develop incremental innovations in a more efficient way than non-family firms (Rojas et al. 2017). As a consequence, we propose the next hypothesis: H1: In a static temporal analysis, family businesses are more innovation-oriented than non-family businesses H1a: Family businesses in their first stage of life (0 to 30 years) are more innovative than non-family businesses H1b: Family businesses in their second stage of life (30 to 60) are more innovative than non-family businesses Family businesses could be expected to benefit from their specific characteristics over time, and therefore it can be formulated that older family businesses can be more innovative, by transmitting the generational legacy in terms of experience and knowledge. In this sense, this influence of the time factor could be more prominent in the case of family businesses, in comparison with non-family businesses, since the specific characteristics of the family business can favor its innovative capacity over time (Beck et al, 2011; Kellermanns et al., 2008). Also the  ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES ISSN 2345-0282 (online) http://jssidoi.org/jesi/ 2020 Volume 7 Number 3 (March) http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2020.7.3(20)  1746  Stewardship orientation could enhance the innovative behavior of family businesses, more than non-family (Rau et al. 2018). On the other hand, the innovative impulse of the company derived from the entrepreneurial character of its founders can be lost, especially in the case of family businesses that can become more conservative over time (Zahra, 2005; Naldi et al., 2007). Business models do not last forever, and the life cycles of the sectors advance in their different stages faster and faster. There is some evidence regarding the average life of companies that hardly exceeds one generation, as revealed by studies in Spain that show an average firm age of 12 years versus 33 years in the case of family firms (Corona, 2015). De Massis et al. (2016) analyzed some long-lasting innovative family firms to illustrate how the past should be considered as an opportunity to discover knowledge that can be transformed into new products. In this way, past knowledge can be a source of competitive advantages, through the reutilization of existing knowledge within the family and the firm as a basis to innovation. Innovative family firms have special capabilities to leverage tradition in order to develop successful new products and services (Rojas, Lorenzo, and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Cacho, 2017). Tradition refers to the stock of knowledge, competencies, materials, manufacturing processes, signs, values and beliefs pertaining to the past. De Massis et al. explain how family firms can innovate through tradition as a new product innovation strategy. In this way dynastic families use innovation as the long-term strategic capacity and initiate radical innovations and corporate renewal in order to continue to survive. Thus, time will also be a contingent variable that affects the innovation processes, for example in the relationship between exploitation and exploration of entrepreneurial opportunities (Allison, McKenny, and Short, 2014; R\u00f6d, 2016). Ambidexterity changes over time in family firms, so it is so important to consider the temporal dimension in organizational studies in general, and in the research of family firms in particular (Sharma et al., 2014). According to these arguments, we propose the following hypothesis: H2: The age of firms influences their innovative capacity Pittino and Visintin (2009) point out that the founders have a greater orientation towards innovation, adopting a more prospective and analytical strategy than the second generation and following companies. The founders have formal and informal power to allocate resources to explore innovative ideas (Zahra, 2005), while the second and subsequent generations adopt a less entrepreneurial strategy, since they are more interested in preserving the company and maximizing its benefits than in the innovative activities, besides not holding power in the absolute form of the founder, although Craig and Moores (2006) argue that the family business can be more innovative in the generations following the first. Also, when the company is immersed in succession processes, the complexity and uncertainty of this stage can lead to a more conservative attitude, as a result of the presence in the management positions of members of two different generations. The influence of the older generation can lead to more conservative strategies (Ensley and Pearson, 2005), so that the inaction of the new leader still in the consolidation phase can be motivated by an inadequate succession process, in which it has been committed errors or that has been closed in false, propitiating a leadership without the necessary capacities to implant the processes of innovation of suitable way. Therefore, the innovative character can be developed in a different way in each generation.  The innovative character of the family business has been analyzed by Craig and Moores (2006), highlighting that family business attaches great importance to innovation as a key component in its strategy, over time, in a sense comparable to the companies that they operate in advanced technology sectors. In their study, Craig and Moores use a longitudinal sample of family businesses, analyzed in two moments with an interval of 10 years of difference and find a relationship that innovation is related to the life cycle of the company, since companies analyzed family members show significantly higher levels of innovation in the early stages of their development.  ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES ISSN 2345-0282 (online) http://jssidoi.org/jesi/ 2020 Volume 7 Number 3 (March) http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2020.7.3(20)  1747  However, this innovative drive does not disappear over time, as consolidated family businesses seem to attach great importance to innovation management. These results suggest that innovation continues to be of considerable importance for family businesses, even for those operating in sectors considered more traditional. As a consequence, we formulate as hypotheses: H3: The generation that rules the company influences its innovative capacity.  H4: The presence of the founder influences his innovative capacity H5: Companies that have had a generational renewal are more innovative than those that have not.  3. Research method  3.1 Sample and Procedure A key issue in every study about family firms is the concretion of what a family firm is. It is not a simple issue because of the lack of a clear differentiation between family firms and non-family firms (Astrachan, Klein y Smyrnios, 2002), in a great extent due to the multidimensional features of the family firms (Uhlaner, 2002; Litz, 1995). According to Gallo (1995), there is a high consensus in considering the ownership, family involvement and desire of continuity as the defining dimensions of family firms. To the effects of our study, we consider a firm as a family firm according to the first two conditions: ownership and family involvement. The condition for ownership is that the family has more than 50% of the shares. Although some criteria for family firms, as the definition by the European Family Businesses Group and the Family Business Network (Corona, 2015), could consider a listed firm as a family firm when the family owns 25% of the shares, we ask for at least 50% of the shares because most of the firms (97.4%) of the considered population are small and medium enterprises (Lorenzo and Rojo, 2015). We also ask for family members as managers or directors in order to measure the family involvement. The third condition for a firm to be considered as a family firm, that is the intention of continuity across generations, is measured by a specific question in the survey, by asking directly to the managers for this intention.  The data for this study were collected through online surveys questionnaires. The survey was sent to the manager of each company, who were contacted by phone. The sample was composed by 1.509 firms. During the period of phone calling were collected 230 responses, thereby was obtained a rate of response of 15.24%. All of them were companies from the region of Andalusia, one of the largest regions in Spain, with more than 8.5 million of people population.   The firms of the sample were taken from the database SABI. In order to select family businesses, we utilize the criteria mentioned in the theoretical framework section, about family ownership and presence of family members in management or government (or both) of the firm. We also ask the sample\u2019s firm about their self-consideration as a family firm. Besides, it were included several questions about the family character in the questionnaire. The sample was finally composed by 155 family businesses and 75 nonfamily businesses that in turn were divided into four different groups: family businesses in first generation, family businesses in second or upper generation, non-family businesses with less than 30 years of age, and non-family businesses with more than 30 years after their establishment in line with Gallo (1995).     ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES ISSN 2345-0282 (online) http://jssidoi.org/jesi/ 2020 Volume 7 Number 3 (March) http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2020.7.3(20)  1748  3.2 Measures Dependent variable: Innovation.  This variable has been assessed using the scale of Beck et al. (2011).  It has been also used in the works of Cooper et al. (1994). Research has supported its construct validity. The scale was composed by 5 items ranged from 1 \u201ctotally disagree\u201d to 5 \u201ctotally agree\u201d. Cronbach alpha coefficient were 0.893.  Independent variables: Family character; Generational period. We classified the companies according to the answers to five questions about the family character included in the questionnaire. We also divided the companies of the sample by following a second criterion that is the age of the company. In the case of family firms, we consider those that are in first generation as a group and those that are in second or upper generations as another group. In order to introduce the time variable in non-family firms, we divided the sample into two different groups, depending of the age of the company was less or more than 30 years. By doing so, we could compare family firms versus non-family firms in different stages of evolution. Generation in control. To determine the generation in control we relied on data obtained from questionnaire. The CEO of the company indicated the number of the generation which is managing the firm (Rau et al. 2018; Bammens et al., 2008). This variable had 5 possible values, from 1 for first generation, to 5 for fifth and later generations.   Presence of the company founder. This variable was measured according the indication of the CEO that was asked about if the founder were controlling the company. The age of the company was measure through the variable \u201cage of the company\u201d taken from SABI database. The age is calculated as the difference between the year of the foundation of the firm and 2017. The variable existence of generational change was measure by asking to the interviewed about the existence of generational change in the company, giving four choices: without changes, first change, second change, third change and others.  3.3 Results of the analysis of variance To determine if there are statistically significant differences between the means of two or more independent groups, you can use a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). First, this analysis has been used to check whether there are significant differences between family businesses and non-family businesses. Second, the Anova analysis has been used to determine if there are significant differences between the four different groups of companies that have been determined. Third, it has been used to determine net differences between the groups in terms of generation, generational change, presence of the founder in the management of the company and seniority.  Since the samples of all the groups do not have the same size, being therefore an \"unbalanced\" design, we have carefully analyzed the existence of any violation of the assumptions about the validity of the ANOVA test, about normality, continuity of the variables, independent categorical variables formed by two or more groups, independence of the observations. In addition, the Tukey tests were used to confirm that the differences detected through the Anova were significant, an adequate method for this type of samples of unequal size.  Regarding the presence of outliers, there were no outliers in the data, as assessed by inspection of a boxplot. Normality of the data (by observing the form of the distribution of each of the groups) and they was homogeneous, assessed by Levene's test of equality of variances (p = .120).  Once it has been verified that the data verify the necessary assumptions, they were analyzed. The Anova analysis propose:  H0: all group population means are equal (i.e., \u00b51 = \u00b52 = \u00b53 = ... = \u00b5k)  If the Anova one way analysis allows us to reject the null hypothesis H0, after that Tukey's post hoc test is performed to compare the means of all the groups and see which ones are statistically different.

(See table 1). Therefore hypothesis 1 that indicated: Family businesses have greater innovative capacity than non-family companies is discarded (Table 1).

Discussion  The study of innovation in family businesses has taken us from an initial phase, in which researchers were surprised by the paradoxical results obtained, often contradictory to each other, to a degree of maturity in which are aware that not all family firms behave equally in the face of innovation. Thus, new factors need to be incorporated into the study and that heterogeneity of family firms must be taken into consideration. At this point we have found a factor that can mark the study of innovation in family businesses is time.   ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES ISSN 2345-0282 (online) http://jssidoi.org/jesi/ 2020 Volume 7 Number 3 (March) http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2020.7.3(20)  1753   Figure 1: Time and Innovation in family businesses. Comparison of results  The Figure 1 shows that time influences on innovation in two ways, one is the moment to measure the degree of innovation, and another is the moment of life of the company. In relation to the first one, since innovation is a process, if we measure it at the beginning of the process, the innovation in the input that was raised, we will obtain a different result than if we measure it at the end of the process. Similarly, if we measure it when firms are launching a new product we will have a perception of innovation different from if it were measured in the maturity of the product.  On the other hand, innovation behavior is also affected by factors that are derived from the age of the company, transitions or relays in the family business, the generation that is in charge, the presence of the founder of the company. In short, there are a series of factors that condition the results of the study because they cannot be compared with groups with different characteristics.  Our research aims to highlight these differentiating characteristics of the family business before innovation, caused by the variable time. For this reason, we have made two types of comparisons, the first between family and non-family businesses, and the second among family businesses themselves.  The first comparison has been made between the first group, formed only by family businesses and the second group formed by non-family businesses. Well, when performing the analysis without considering any time variable, looking for possible differences between both groups with respect to innovation, the results obtained by the ANOVA test of a factor indicate that there are no significant differences between the means of both groups. This result is in line with other research such as Basco and Calabr\u00f3 (2016). After that, we wanted to introduce a temporary variable to see what results our data offered. This variable could be the generation in control of the company. However, although it was a measurable aspect in family businesses, not in family businesses.   For this reason, we seek a temporary equivalence of the generation, which is also measurable in non-family businesses. The answer was provided by the work of Tapies (2009), which placed the temporal equivalence to a       Analysis Innovation FB\u00b4s vs non FB\u2019s non FB\u2019s Analysis Innovation FB\u00b4s vs non FB\u2019s FB\u00b4s = = < FB\u00b4s > 30 Non FB\u00b4s > 30 FB\u00b4s < 30 Non FB\u00b4s < 30   Analysis IFB\u00b4S: Innovation / Generation 1\u00ba Gen. 2\u00ba Gen. <   ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES ISSN 2345-0282 (online) http://jssidoi.org/jesi/ 2020 Volume 7 Number 3 (March) http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2020.7.3(20)  1754  generational period, around 30 years. For this reason, we group companies assimilating the first generation to the period of 0 to 30 years, and the second generation to the period of 31 to 60 years. In this way, we obtained four groups: the first, family businesses up to 30 years old; the second, non-family businesses up to 30 years old; the third, family businesses with more than 30 years and the fourth, non-family businesses more than 30 years old.  When introducing the time variable, the results of the comparison between groups 1 and 2 show that both family and non-family businesses have a similar behavior in innovation. In other words, there are no significant differences between family businesses and non-family businesses in the early stages of the company's life. However, in the case of older companies, 3 and 4, non-family businesses are more innovative than family businesses. Regardless of other considerations, the results show that when the time variable is introduced in the analysis to discriminate the categories, the results are different from the previous analysis, which was the case of hypothesis 1, in which temporal considerations were not included.  Focused on the results of family businesses, to introduce the temporary nature of these organizations, we use the generation in command. Well, the Anova analysis of differences between the companies of the four generational groups (first, second, third and fourth or greater), showed different behaviors between the groups in innovation. That is, according to the generation in charge in the company, this will be more or less innovative. In the post hoc evaluation of the results, using the Tukey test, we observed that the second generation was the most innovative.   5. Conclusion, limitations and future research lines  In the study of innovation in family businesses, it is necessary to take into account the time variable and the temporal heterogeneity of the companies. As we have seen in the article, heterogeneity is not exclusive to family businesses, also those that are not family businesses, since these also exhibit different innovation behaviors at different stages of life. In this context, the time elapsed since the creation of the company, the generation that is in charge and, specifically, the presence of the founder in it can condition the results of the innovation processes in the case of family businesses.  Therefore, the first contribution of this work to the study of innovation in the family business is that we have to consider the time variable as a critical factor with respect to innovation, both for the time or the life cycle of the company, as for the moment in which we measure innovation.  As a second contribution, it should be noted that the generation in charge conditions the company's behavior in the face of innovation. In this sense, we observe how the second generation is more innovative than the first. We also conclude that there are no significant differences between family businesses and non-family businesses in the early stages, with respect to innovation behavior. It could be that the initial innovative impulse that leads the entrepreneur to create a business does not depend on the family condition of the company. In addition, continuing with the analysis of family businesses, those that have completed the generational change are more innovative than those that have not.  This document has certain limitations. First, the use of questionnaires and small samples to collect information implies the specific limitations that arise from the subjectivity involved in the use of this tool. When questionnaires are used, the researcher does not directly address the phenomenon under study and respondents have a margin of freedom of interpretation that can distort the target set. In addition, respondents' responses may reflect their own prejudices, since many items are based on the respondent's perception.  Another limitation originates in the horizontal nature of the investigation. The information was collected at a given time, with the exception of certain innovation indicators. It would be worth analyzing these relationships  ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES ISSN 2345-0282 (online) http://jssidoi.org/jesi/ 2020 Volume 7 Number 3 (March) http://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2020.7.3(20)  1755  between innovation and independent variables through the use of prolonged periods to isolate temporal phenomena that could distort the result, as we formulate in this article.

Knowledge of the toughening\nof fibrous materials, concentrating the underlying toughening\nmechanisms in microstructures, offers important guidelines for\nthe design of engineering materials. The nonlinear defomation\nresponses of fibrous networks is crucial to be considered in the\nunderstanding of their damage tolerance. Such consideration\nis, however, a difficult task because it involves microscopic\nmechanical responses at a small length scale. The microscopic\nresponses was incorporated into macroscopic domain using finite\nelement analysis. The detailed study of microstructures at crack\ntips explains how nonlinear deformation responses of fibrous net-\nworks can improve their defect tolerance. The network flexibility\nallows fibers to dissipate energy through the fiber rearrangement\nand thus reducing stress concentration at the crack tip. As a\nresult, the random networks formed into fiber bundles, which\naligned perpendicular to the crack tip.\nIndex Terms\u2014Fibrous Networks, Damage Tolerance, Finite\nElement Analysis, Toughening\nI. INTRODUCTION\nStructures of random fibrous networks exist in both natural\nand synthetic fibrous materials. Example of natural fibrous ma-\nterials include fetal membrane and arteries whereas examples\nsynthetic fibrous materials include electrospun scaffolds and\nfabris. An understanding of the fracture of fibrous materials\nis crucial in both nature and engineering contexts. Fracture of\ntissues is related to sport injuries and other clinical conditions\nsuch as fetal membrane rupture in premature birth. The under-\nstanding of such failure processes gives insight in preventing\nand formulating new treatments for these clinical problems.\nFurther, knowledge of toughening of fibrous materials offers\nimportant guidlines in the design of enineering materials.\nOur previous works show that the damage tolerance in\nrandom fibrous networks is distinctive [2]. The gelatin fibrous\nnetworks were sensitve to flaws but the PCL fibrous networks\nwere damage tolerant to flaws. This paper presents one of\nthe main features that govern the damage tolerance\u2013network\nproperties. The nonlinear deformation responses of networks\naffects the damage tolerance and further improves the material\ntoughness.\nII. FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS\nA. Deformation Analysis\nThe fibrous networks were constructed in 50 \u00d7 50 \u00b5m2\nunit cell models. The unit cell was loaded in two conditions,\n1Faculty of Mechanical and Manufacturing, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn\nMalaysia, 81310 Parit Raja, Johor, Malaysia\n2Cambridge University Engineering Department, Trumpington Street, Cam-\nbridge CB2 1PZ, UK.\n*Corresponding author\u2019s e-mail: ctkoh@uthm.edu.my (Ching Theng Koh)\npure shear and uniaxial tension tests. For pure shear test, the\nfibrils were bonded at rigid plates at all edges, the bottom\nplate was pinned, and the top plate was sheared horizontally.\nFor uniaxial tension test, the fibril were bonded at rigid plates\nat all edges, the left plate was fixed horizontally and the right\nplate was pulled horizontally. The deformation behaviour of\nfibrous networks were studied using linear, Neo-Hookean and\npolynomial hyperelastic models.\nB. Fracture Analysis\nMechanical responses of fibrous materials were studied at\ntwo length scales: the macroscopic model at millimeter scale\nand the microscopic model at micrometer scale (Figure 1).\nThe macroscopic model consists of a strip with 25 mm width,\n3 mm height and 6 mm notch length, modeled by two-\ndimensional plane stress elements in finite element software\nABAQUS (Version 6.11, SIMULIA, Providence, RI). It was\npulled uniformly in vertical direction along the upper edge\nand constrained vertically at the bottom edge. All simulations\nwere performed using nonlinear finite element analysis, which\nconsiders large strains and rotations. The microscopic models\nconsist of two dimensional fibrous networks, constructed in\ncircular unit cells.\nThe network properties including fibril modulus Ef =\n100MPa, cross-link density \u03c1density = 2.35\u00b10.15\u00b5m\u22122 and\nfibril diameter df = 50 nm [5] are representative of collage-\nnous networks in amnion (i.e. a thin collagenous membrane\ncontinuous with the placenta [4]). The fibres were defined by\nstretching stiffness \u00b5 (i.e. axial force needed to stretch a unit\naxial strain) and bending stiffness \u03ba (i.e. bending moment\nneeded to bend a unit radius of curvature). A noodle-like\nbehavior resembling collagen fibrils was defined: the fibrils\nwere very easy to bend (\u00b5 = 1x10-15 Nm2) but difficult to\nstretch (\u03ba = 5 N) [3].\nFigure 1. Schematic illustraion of the inelastic region (middle) in the\nmacroscopic models (left) and the fibrous networks in the microscopic models\n(right).\nThe failure criterion was defined as following: a fiber\nruptures whenever local stress exceeds the tensile fracture\nstrength of fibrils, defined as \u03c3f = 30MPa. The experimental\nICCE-21 (COMPOSITES PART B: ENGINEERING) 2\nmeasurements of the fracture strength of collagen fibrils vary\nfrom 20 MPa to 600 MPa [1]. In ABAQUS, failure (e.g. critical\ncrack opening) was determined whenever the local maximum\nstress of fibrils reached the strength of fiber. The critical crack\nopening was obtained when the first fibril ruptures and allows\ncrack propagation.\nIII. NONLINEAR RESPONSES OF FIBROUS NETWORKS\nThe stress\u2013strain curves obtained from the FE analysis\nof the short fibrous networks are shown in Figure 2. Both\nthe tension and shear stress-strain curves show an increase\nin slopes, suggesting a strain stiffening behaviour. Material\nmodels used to define the nonlinear behaviour of fibrous\nnetworks include Neo-Hookean and polynomial models. The\npolynomial models fit the nonlinear behaviour better than Neo-\nHookean model.\nFigure 2. Nonlinear deformation responses of short fibrous (SF) networks for\nthe uniaxial tension test (blue dots) and shear test (black dots). Two material\nmodels, Neo-Hookean (dash lines) and polynomial models (solid lines), were\nused to define the nonlinear responses of fibrous networks.\nIV. DEFECT TOLERANCE OF FIBROUS NETWORKS\nFigure 3 shows that the maximum stress of fibers in fibrous\nnetworks was increased when the crack opening increased.\nEstimation by linear, Neo-Hookean and polynomial models\nshow a significant difference in critical stress estimation. The\nfiber strength \u03c3f = 30MPa indicates the initiation of crack\npropagation. The crack starts propagating at the corresponding\nmacroscopic crack opening (\u03b4\u221e/h) of approximate 0.0195,\n0.023 and 0.032, predicted by linear, Neo-Hookean and poly-\nnomial hyperelastic models respectively. The long fibrous\nnetwork exhibits significantly larger maximum stress than the\nshort fibrous networks. The linear model has smaller maxi-\nmum stress estimation than of hyperelastic models, suggesting\nthat linear assumption for boundary condition of microscopic\nmodels can underestimate the fracture behaviour.\nFurthermore, the hyperelastic networks allow for network\nrearrangement in the vicinity of the notch without resulting in\nlarge strain on the individual fibers. The flexibility of network\nrearrangement around the crack tip depends on a combination\nof factors, including fiber stiffness, fiber undulation, fiber\ndensity and bonding among fibers.\nFigure 3. Critical stress in the fibrous networks estimated by the linear, Neo-\nHookean and polynomial models\nV. CONCLUSION\nComputational modeling that considers network architecture\nat a microscopic scale shows promise in explaining non-linear\ndeformation responses and toughening behaviour of fibrous\nnetworks. The nonlinear deformation responses of networks\naffects the damage tolerance and further improves the material\ntoughness. This suggests that the damage tolerance of a fibrous\nmaterial can be enhanced by designing the architecture of\nfibrous networks, which exhibit hyperelastic behaviour.\nACKNOWLEGMENT\nFinancial support from the Ministry of Higher Education\nMalaysia is gratefully acknowledged.\nREFERENCES\n[1] C. a.

IntroductionDark chocolate contains a group of phytochemicals known as flavonoids, which naturally occurin many fruits and vegetables. The consumption of flavonoids and flavonoid-rich foods has beenassociated with numerous health benefits, and reviews of the literature indicate that cocoa flavonoids areassociated with benefits to cardiovascular health [1] and cognitive function [2,3]. For example, chronictrials ranging from 8 weeks to three months show that daily consumption of flavonoid-rich cocoa isassociated with positive effects on working memory and executive function in healthy older adults [4\u20136].These chronic effects are accompanied by changes in cerebral blood flow [4,7] which is indicative of acerebrovascular mechanism of action; for a review, see [8]. Changes in the brain-derived neurotrophicfactor (BDNF), a protein associated with neuronal growth, have also been observed following twelveweeks of cocoa flavonoid consumption [9]. An acute cerebrovascular mechanism [10] also has potentialto impact cognitive function in the immediate hours following cocoa flavonoid consumption. Indeed,a double-blind crossover design in healthy young adults [11] showed improvements in executivefunction up to 1 h following consumption of a flavonoid-rich cocoa drink relative to a low flavonoidcontrol. Furthermore, improved spatial working memory in addition to benefits for visual contrastsensitivity two hours following dark chocolate consumption relative to a white chocolate control inhealthy young adults has been shown [12], indicating that vascular benefits may extend to the retina.Moreover, dark chocolate bar consumption has also been associated with acute executive functionimprovements in adults aged 18\u201340 years [13] and these effects have been supported by changes inNutrients 2020, 12, 483; doi:10.3390/nu12020483 www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrientsNutrients 2020, 12, 483 2 of 9flow-mediated dilation [14] and changes in the concentration of oxygenated blood in the cortex, asmeasured with near-infrared spectroscopy in the immediate hours after consumption [15]. The majorityof these supportive studies have administered pre-prepared chocolate drinks or dark chocolate barscontaining concentrations of flavonoids (between 250\u20131000 mg), which are likely to be higher thanthat found in commercially available dark chocolate bars. Therefore, the focus of this research wasto explore whether acute cognitive benefits are observed two hours post consumption of a 35 g darkchocolate bar commercially available in the UK, relative to a 35 g calorie-matched low flavonoid whitechocolate bar. In support, benefits to non-cognitive outcomes, such as coronary circulation [16] andvisual acuity/contrast sensitivity [17], have been seen following consumption of commercially availabledark chocolate relative to a white or milk chocolate control. White chocolate is a viable comparator inthat it has similar sensory properties to dark chocolate without the presence of flavonoids and canbe matched for weight and calories. For consumers, it is also a realistic alternative to dark chocolate.The rationale for assessing performance two hours post consumption is based on evidence showingthat this time frame reflects a period of absorption, digestion and metabolism of cocoa flavonoids forwhich vascular and behavioural effects are observed [10\u201318]. The aforementioned evidence indicatesbenefits predominantly for executive function and spatial memory, however, few studies have exploredeffects on verbal episodic memory. Cocoa-associated increases in hippocampal cerebral blood flowand concomitant benefits to spatial memory have been observed [4], and, given the important of thehippocampus for episodic memory, it is reasonable to hypothesise that cocoa-induced improvementsmay be seen for measures of verbal memory. Previously, subtle effects on subjective mood outcomes,such as fatigue [11,13] and contentment [18] following cocoa flavanols, have been seen; therefore,the present study also assesses subjective mood pre and post consumption. To summarize, the aimwas to explore whether benefits to episodic verbal memory and mood are observed two hours postconsumption of a commercially available dark chocolate bar relative to a white chocolate bar in healthyyoung adults.2. Materials and Methods2.1. DesignA parallel groups design was implemented with two treatments: dark chocolate (DC) and whitechocolate (WC). Participants were assigned to treatments on arrival by the experimenter accordingto a predetermined alternating order generated by the principle investigator who did not collect anydata (i.e., DC then WC then DC then WC). Outcome measures were assessed at two test sessions: preconsumption (Baseline) and two hours post consumption. Both treatments were matched for calories(203 kcal) and weight (35 g) and were commercially available 35 g organic products (produced by Greenand Black\u2019s\u00a9, London, UK). The 35 g serving was chosen on the basis that this is a portion of chocolatetypically consumed. The macronutrient content of the DC and WC treatments (respectively) was fat 15g and 13 g; saturated fat 8.8 g and 8 g; carbohydrate 13 g and 18 g; sugars 10 g and 18 g; protein 3.2 g and2.8 g; fibre 3.5 g and 0.01 g; salt 0.03 and 0.09 g. The DC was 70% cocoa content. The specific flavonoidcontent was not assessed. A database (http://phenol-explorer.eu/contents/food/439 accessed 15/08/2019)collating the analysis from multiple peer reviewed studies of dark chocolate using chromatographymethods indicates a total flavonoid content of 237 mg/100 g which would equate to an 83 mg flavonoiddose for the DC treatment here. White chocolate contains no flavonoids [16]. This research was givena favourable opinion for conduct by the University of Reading School of Psychology and ClinicalLanguage Sciences Research Ethics Committee (ref 2018-126-DL).Nutrients 2020, 12, 483 3 of 92.2. ParticipantsNinety-eight healthy young adults (n = 57 females) were recruited (n = 49 DC and n = 49 WC) viaopportunistic sampling from the University of Reading student population using posters and onlineadvertisements. Exclusion criteria were any mental or physical illness, currently taking medication orsupplements and smoking. Inclusion criteria were aged between 18\u201324, English speaker, and currentlyenrolled in a university degree programme. The latter enabled control over educational attainment,which is a predictor of episodic memory performance. Table 1 shows the demographic data brokendown by treatment group. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for anyof the demographic variables (p > 0.05).Table 1.

Outcome MeasuresRey\u2019s Auditory Verbal Learning Task (AVLT) [19] is a well-established measure of episodic memory.Participants heard an auditory recording of 15 nouns (list A), read at 1 per second. Each presentationwas followed by a free verbal recall of this list (recalls A1\u2013A5). A new list of 15 nouns (list B) wasintroduced as an interference list on Trial 6 and was recalled once only (recall B). After a short delay(2 min), participants then free recalled List A without hearing the words. Two versions of the AVLTwere used as previously described [20], which were counterbalanced across test sessions. A series ofvalidated outcome measures were calculated according to Lezak [20] and previous research [21,22]:immediate word span (recall A1); words learnt (recall A5\u2013A1); final acquisition (recall A5); totalacquisition (sum A1 through A5); proactive interference (recall A1\u2013B); retroactive interference (recallA5\u2013A6); delayed recall (A6) and total recall (all trials).Subjective mood was assessed with two questionnaires: the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule(PANAS) [23] and the Bond-Lader [24]. A computerised version of the PANAS was administered,which required a response using the keyboard based on the level to which participants were experienceeach adjective at that moment using a 5 point scale (1 very slightly or not at all; 2 a little; 3 moderately;4 quite a bit; 5 very much). There are two outcome variables: (i) Positive Affect and (ii) NegativeAffect, with a higher score representing higher levels of affect. The Bond-Lader is a series of 16 visualanalogue scales (VAS) of 100 mm length, which requires the participant to indicate how they are feelingat that moment by marking the line. Each VAS is anchored by two adjectives (one at each end, e.g.,alert\u2013drowsy). There are three outcome variables: (i) Alertness, (ii) Contentment, and (iii) Anxiety,with higher scores indicating higher levels of each measure.2.4. ProceduresAll testing took place at the University of Reading School of Psychology in individual cubicles.Interested participants were checked for inclusion and exclusion criteria by email, phone call, or inperson prior to attending the test day. Two hours prior to arrival on the test day, participants wererequired to fast from all food and drink except water. Informed consent was attained on arrival, atwhich point demographic measures were collected by a self-report questionnaire. Height and weightwere measured by the experimenters. First, the Bond Lader was completed followed by PANAS andthe AVLT. Participants then consumed the assigned treatment. Session 1 lasted approximately 30min. Participants then left the laboratory and were required to remain fasted (expect water) untilNutrients 2020, 12, 483 4 of 9returning two hours later for Session 2. Session 2 followed the same procedure as Session 1, withoutthe demographic measure assessment. Session 1 commenced anytime between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m.All data was collected between November 2018 and February 2019. Laboratory conditions, such ashumidity, illuminance, and ambient temperature, were not assessed but remained constant throughouteach test day. The experimenters were not blinded to the treatment on the test day, however, the moodand cognitive assessments were undertaken in a cubicle without the presence of the experimenter, andthe responses were collected and subsequently coded by a computer to allow blinding for the analysis,which was undertaken by the principal investigator. All outcome variables were assessed with a 2 \u00d7 2(Treatment*Session) mixed ANOVA. Significant interactions were clarified with post hoc independentt-tests comparing the two treatments at each time point, with a Bonferroni corrected alpha adjustmentfor type 1 error.3. ResultsAs shown in Table 2, significant Treatment*Session interactions were observed for several episodicmemory outcome measures, with the t-test showing that the DC was associated with benefits toepisodic memory relative to WC at 2 h, whilst at the pre-consumption baseline there were no differencesbetween the treatments.Table 2.

Discussion The findings indicate that the consumption of a standard 35 g 70% cocoa dark chocolate bar can benefit verbal episodic memory relative to an equicaloric 35 g white chocolate bar two hours post consumption in healthy young adults. Previously, acute cognitive benefits in healthy young and middle-aged adults following cocoa consumption have been seen for measures of executive function and processing speed [11\u201313], spatial memory [12], and working memory [14]. This is one of the first reported observations of improved verbal episodic memory two hours post cocoa consumption. The benefit was notable in that seventeen more words were recalled following DC relative to WC over the course of seven trials. In support of the validity of the present findings, the task used (RAVLT) has shown sensitivity to other acute flavonoid interventions, including blueberries (see [25] for a review) and the Haskap berry [26]. The present data shows that recall was enhanced at all trials during the RAVLT following the DC relative to WC, indicating an increased capacity to learn words at initial presentation and throughout the task, including the short-delayed recall. Interestingly, there were no effects of interference, which suggests that the DC did not reduce the process of forgetting caused by the learning of new words or reduce the effect of old learning on new learning. The benefit of increasing one\u2019s capacity to learn and recall words, with few effects on interference, is also seen in the blueberry flavonoid literature [25]. It would be of interest to explore effects on delayed recall ~30 min post learning and other complex subtleties of verbal episodic memory, such as source monitoring, which may give insight into the brain regions affected and the mechanisms of action. A possible mechanism of action within a two-hour timeframe is increased cerebral blood flow following flavonoid-rich cocoa, which has previously been demonstrated using MRI arterial spin labelling in resting state following a 493 mg flavanol cocoa drink Fig re 1.

A poss ble mechanis of actio withi a two-hourtimeframe is increased cerebral blood flow following flavonoid-rich cocoa, which has previously beendemonstrated using MRI a terial spin labelling in resting state following a 493 mg flavanol cocoaNutrients 2020, 12, 483 6 of 9drink in healthy older adults [10] and following a 519 mg flavanol drink in healthy young females [7];for a review of cerebral blood flow effects following cocoa, see [8]. Of particular relevance for thememory benefits seen here are the observations of increased cerebral blood volume in a sub-region ofthe hippocampus (dentate gyrus) following 30 days of cocoa consumption, which indicates that areasof the brain associated with episodic memory are sensitive to cocoa flavanols. Indeed, flavonoids andtheir metabolites have been detected in the hippocampus and other areas associated with memoryand learning, such as the cerebral cortex and cerebellum [27\u201329]. Increased cerebral blood flowfollowing cocoa flavonoid ingestion may lead to acute cognitive benefits, such as improved episodicmemory by a process of enhanced neurovascular coupling, whereby an increase in oxygen and glucosedemand induced by increased neuronal activity during a cognitive task is met by increased bloodflow to the region of activity due to the presence of cocoa flavonoids, via an mechanism of nitricoxide synthesis, which is a known pathway by which cocoa flavonoids can increase vasodilation [30].In support of this, benefits to reaction time and concomitant increases in the fMRI BOLD (bloodoxygen level\u2013dependent) response in brain regions activated by an executive function task have beenobserved two hours post consumption of a 900 mg cocoa flavanol drink [15]. A notable outcomeof the present research is that cognitive benefits were seen following an everyday portion of 70%cocoa dark chocolate. Whilst the exact flavonoid content is unknown, information from validateddatabases indicates it to be approximately 80\u201390 mg (see method), which is considerably lower thanthe majority of other acute cocoa flavonoid studies ranging from 250\u20131000 mg. This is encouragingfor consumers and compliments epidemiological cross-sectional data showing positive associationsbetween habitual chocolate intake and cognitive performance in 938 community-dwelling adults aged23\u201398 [31] and in 2031 older adults aged 72 [32], both of which control for various cardiovascular,lifestyle, and dietary factors. Similarly, longitudinal data in 531 older adults (>65 years) reports arelationship between increased chocolate intake at initial assessment and a lower risk of cognitivedecline several years later [33]. It would be of interest to extend these findings to clinical populationswith memory impairments such as Mild Cognitive Impairment, in whom executive function benefitshave been seen following eight weeks daily intake of a cocoa flavanol-rich drink [6]. Similarly, researchinto the chronic effects of everyday portions of DC on episodic memory in health adults would furtherour understanding of the association between evidence from clinical and epidemiological trials. Thecurrent study shows no DC benefits for subjective mood outcomes, which may indicate that the dose isinsufficient, since other studies show reduced fatigue and higher contentment following >500 mg cocoaflavonoids (see [34] for an overview), however, it was interesting to observe an overall better moodstate at Session Two relative to Session One, as indicated by an increase in positive affect and a decreasein negative affect. This may reflect the anticipation of test day completion and subsequently eatinglunch given that participants had been fasted (notwithstanding the treatments) for at least four hours.Alternatively, this finding could reflect that simply consuming chocolate (DC or WC) was a positiveexperience and reduced negative feelings. The increase in anxiety between sessions was unexpectedbut could be due to negative anticipatory feelings associated with performing the RAVLT, as, uponcompleting the mood measures at Session One, participants were unfamiliar with the task. Theseexplanations have no empirical support, and future research may benefit from assessing the sensoryproperties of the treatments. Indeed, a limitation is that the sensory properties may have contributedto the cognitive effects (e.g., taste/pleasure), however, this hypothesis is somewhat countered by anabsence of differences in positive and negative affect between the DC and WC. A further limitation isthe absence of an assessment of lifestyle factors, such as sleep quality, habitual diet, physical activitypatterns, and hormonal variations, such as the menstrual cycle, which could have contributed tovariance in cognitive function. Whilst a strength of this research is the commercial availability of thetreatments, clearly, interpretations relating to the flavonoid content are limited in the absence of itsassessment. Future research should, where possible attain the content of flavonoids and other activeingredients, such as theobromine and caffeine, (estimated here to be 390 mg and 35 mg, respectively,based on [35]). There is currently limited evidence for the individual contribution of theobromineNutrients 2020, 12, 483 7 of 9for cognition [36], and reviews indicate caffeine doses >38 mg are require for discernible effects oncognition [37].5. ConclusionsIn summary, this research shows that 70% cocoa dark chocolate consumption can benefit verbalepisodic memory two hours post consumption in healthy young adults relative to a white chocolatecontrol. These findings support the notion that everyday available portions (35 g) of dark chocolatecan confer benefits to the brain in healthy consumers.Author Contributions: D.J.L. led the conceptualization, analysis, manuscript preparation, supervision and projectadministration.

Control of grain expansion by the maternally derivedpericarp of the grain has previously been suggested, although this interaction has not been investigated underhigh p.a. temperatures. Down-regulation of pericarp localised genes that regulate cell wall expansion under highp.a. temperatures may limit expansion of the encapsulated endosperm due to a loss of plasticity in the pericarp,reducing mature grain weight. Here the effect of high p.a. temperatures on the transcriptome of the pericarp andendosperm of the wheat grain during early grain-filling was investigated via RNA-Seq and is discussed alongsidegrain moisture dynamics during early grain development and mature grain weight.Results: High p.a. temperatures applied from 6-days after anthesis (daa) and until 18daa reduced the grain\u2019s abilityto accumulate water, with total grain moisture and percentage grain moisture content being significantly reducedfrom 14daa onwards. Mature grain weight was also significantly reduced by the same high p.a. temperaturesapplied from 6daa for 4-days or more, in a separate experiment. Comparison of our RNA-Seq data from wholegrains, with existing data sets from isolated pericarp and endosperm tissues enabled the identification of subsets ofgenes whose expression was significantly affected by high p.a. temperature and predominantly expressed in eithertissue. Hierarchical clustering and gene ontology analysis resulted in the identification of a number of genesimplicated in the regulation of cell wall expansion, predominantly expressed in the pericarp and significantly down-regulated under high p.a. temperatures, including endoglucanase, xyloglucan endotransglycosylases and a \u03b2-expansin. An over-representation of genes involved in the \u2018cuticle development\u2019 functional pathway that wereexpressed in the pericarp and affected by high p.a. temperatures was also observed.Conclusions: High p.a. temperature induced down-regulation of genes involved in regulating pericarp cell wallexpansion. This concomitant down-regulation with a reduction in total grain moisture content and grain weightfollowing the same treatment period, adds support to the theory that high p.a. temperatures may cause areduction in mature grain weight as result of decreased pericarp cell wall expansion.Keywords: RNA-Seq, Wheat, Grain development, Post-anthesis, Temperature, Cell wall, Pericarp, Transcriptomics\u00a9 The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you giveappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate ifchanges were made.

BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:170 Page 2 of 17BackgroundIncreases in average global temperatures of between0.35\u20130.7 \u00b0C by the year 2035 have been predicted andare expected to be accompanied by an increase in thefrequency and severity of extreme high temperatureevents such as heatwaves and exceptionally hot days [1].High temperatures (> ~ 28\u201330 \u00b0C [2]), when experiencedpost-anthesis (p.a.) can significantly reduce mature grainweight in wheat, consequently reducing yields [3\u20136].Several physiological responses have been identified ascausal to the reduction in wheat grain weight observedfollowing high p.a. temperature exposure and theymainly relate to source limiting factors such as reducedchlorophyll content [7], reduced root biomass [8] andreduced mobilization of photoassimilates [9]. However,it has also been suggested that exposure to high p.a.temperatures may induce cell wall modifications withinthe developing wheat grain affecting the sink capacity ofthe grain and contributing to the observed reduction ingrain weight [10, 11].Cereal grain growth requires both the endosperm andthe maternally derived tissue that surrounds it, i.e. thepericarp, to expand during grain filling, and it has beensuggested that the pericarp may exert physical controlover the size of the wheat grain endosperm by allowingor containing its expansion [10, 12, 13]. Thisphenomenon, in turn, would be regulated by the poten-tial and ability for expansion of pericarp cell walls. Theexpression pattern of gene transcripts with a high degreeof homology to a cell wall modifying protein in wheatgrain, \u03b1-expansin (pTaExpA6), appear to corroboratethis hypothesis: the expression of these genes peaked ataround 2-6daa in the pericarp prior to the genes beingexpressed also in the endosperm [10]. Further evidenceof the role played by the pericarp on grain size potentialis the identification in a double haploid wheat mappingpopulation of a robust QTL for increased pericarp celllength, associated with longer grains and a 6.9% increasein grain weight [13]. In optimal growing conditions (12\u201321 \u00b0C for wheat [14, 15]) the process of grain expansionis highly coordinated between the pericarp and endo-sperm [16, 17], however, the interaction between thetwo tissues has not been investigated in depth underhigh p.a. temperatures. Previous studies investigating theeffect of high temperature on maternal tissues have fo-cused on high temperatures during the pre-anthesisperiod and, therefore, on their impact on the size of thematernal carpels. High temperature was observed to in-duce a reduction in size of the carpels with a correlationbetween carpel size pre-anthesis and final grain weighthaving also being reported [18]. A number of cell wallmodifying proteins have been identified in cereal grainsas putatively facilitating the expansion of the differenttissues of the grain during early grain development,including expansins (EXPs) [10] and xyloglucan endo-transglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) [19]. However, theexpression patterns of these proteins within the differentwheat grain layers under high p.a. temperatures is un-known. Global transcriptomic datasets from RNA-Seqand microarray profiling of wheat grain, both at thewhole grain [20] and individual tissue scale [21\u201323] arenow publicly available. One of these transcriptomic stud-ies included an analysis of grain grown under hightemperature which showed that increased temperatureresulted in an acceleration of the normal trends in tran-scriptomic expression [20], which is consistent with anoverall acceleration of grain development observedunder high temperature regimes. In order to investigatewhether high p.a. temperatures reduce grain weight bycausing a premature decrease in the ability of the cellwalls of the pericarp to expand during development withrespect to the endosperm, analysis of the effect of highp.a. temperature on the transcriptome of these tissues isrequired.In this study, we compared RNA-Seq data obtainedfrom whole grains that underwent a p.a. hightemperature treatment against existing sequence datafrom individual pericarp and endosperm tissue, with theaim to identify genes predominantly expressed in thesetissues and whose expression patterns are significantlyaffected by temperature. In addition, the effect of highp.a. temperatures on mature grain weight, and grainmoisture content dynamics was also investigated due tothe close association between grain moisture contentand shifts in transcript expression [20], and betweenmaximum grain moisture content and final grainweight [24].ResultsTwo separate experiments were performed, the first (Ex-periment 1) aimed at determining the specific parame-ters, i.e. temperature and the length of application ofthis temperature, that induced a heat stress response inthe specific wheat cultivar used, measurable as a reduc-tion in mature grain weight. The second experiment(Experiment 2) aimed at investigating the effect of highp.a. temperature on grain moisture dynamics and on thetranscriptomic profiles of the pericarp and endosperm.Mature grain dry weight and grain yieldAverage mature grain weight in primary tillers was sig-nificantly reduced in Experiment 1 by exposure to highp.a. temperature treatments for durations of 4-days ormore based on comparison of the least significant differ-ences (LSDs) of the means against the overall mean foreach treatment (ANOVA, df = 6, f = 3.54, p = < 0.05).However, there was no significant difference betweenKino et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:170 Page 3 of 17the control treatment group and those subjected to 2-days of high p.a. temperature (Fig. 1).On a whole plant basis (see \u201cAdditional file 1\u201d) therewas no significant difference between treatments in ma-ture grain number; however, high p.a. temperature treat-ment over 4 days length generally produced significantlylower average mature grain weights (ANOVA, df = 6, f =6.89, p = < 0.001), and therefore, lower grain yield (theexception being the 12-days long treatment, for whichno statistically significant difference in grain yield wasobserved).Grain moisture content and dry matter accumulationdynamicsAverage percentage grain moisture content. was signifi-cantly affected by high p.a. temperature treatment(ANOVA, df = 1, f = 1048.70, p = < 0.001) in addition toaverage total grain moisture content (ANOVA, df = 1,f = 224.80, p = < 0.001) in Experiment 2, with a signifi-cant interaction effect of daa in both (ANOVA, df = 6,f = 65.53 1. 34.82 2. p = < 0.001). Average percentagegrain moisture content (Fig. 2 (a)) and average totalmoisture content (Fig. 2 (b)) were significantly reducedin high p.a. temperature treated grains from 14daa on-wards according to the LSDs of the means. No signifi-cant difference was observed in grain filling rate betweenthe two treatments, but the duration of grain filling wasshorter in the treated plants (Fig. 2 (c)).Fig. 1 Average mature dried grain weight and grain number from primarylengths (number of days) from 6daa.

Treatments with theWheat grain transcriptomics data analysisRNA-Seq statisticsRNA-Seq transcriptomes were obtained for RNA iso-lated from whole grain at 6daa (2 reps), 10daa and14daa (3 reps each) for controls, and at 10daa and14daa (3 reps each) for high p.a. temperature treatedsamples. RNA-Seq statistics for the 14 sequencedsamples are displayed in \u201cAdditional file 2\u201d. The low-est alignment rate was 79.1%, the average alignmentrate was 89.68%.Principal component analysis (PCA)The RNA-Seq data set of the 14 samples was subjectedto principal component analysis (PCA). The data showedclear grouping of replicate samples for same develop-mental stage and treatment groups, indicating similargene expression between samples within treatmentgroups (Fig. 3). The first principle component (PC1)accounted for 78% of variance in gene expression be-tween samples and separated points mostly by develop-mental stage (increasing with decreasing PC1). Thesecond principle component (PC2) captures the secondgreatest variation (effect of high p.a. temperature treat-ment) and accounted for 9% of the total variance in geneexpression between samples. Points for control sampleshad lower PC1 values the later their daa stage, andtreated samples had lower PC1 values than controls,indicating that PC1 is primarily reflecting graintillers exposed to high p.a. temperature treatment (35 \u00b0C) for differentr of the means of 8 biological replicates.

[23] (RNA isolatedfrom inner and outer layers of pericarp and from endo-sperm of 12daa grains) and Pellny (published online:Arrayexpress - E-MTAB-8397) (RNA isolated from purestarchy endosperm of 17daa grains) allowed for genes pre-dominantly expressed in either the pericarp or the endo-sperm to be determined. The expression patterns of thesegenes were then analysed in the RNA-Seq data obtainedFig. 3 Principal component analysis of the transcript counts for the 14 samples analysed by RNA-SEQ. PC1 on the X axis captures the greatestvariation (p.a. developmental stage) and accounts for 78% of the total variance around the PCs whilst PC2 on the Y axis captures the secondgreatest variation (effect of high p.a. temperature treatment) and accounts for 9% of the total variance around the PCs. Samples with similartranscription patterns group togetherKino et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:170 Page 5 of 17in this experiment from whole grain. In both the abovementioned tissue-specific studies, the experimental mater-ial was grown under similar environmental conditions asours (e.g. ~ 18 \u00b0C) and in the study by Pearce et al. [23]grains were sampled at a stage (~12daa) similar to thatused in our whole-grain RNAseq experiment.Initial analysis of differential gene expression betweenthe pericarp and endosperm RNA-Seq reference datasets [23, Pellny, published online, Arrayexpress - E-MTAB-8397] revealed 39,823 DEGs. After cross com-parison and filtering, 463 genes were determined to bepredominantly expressed in the pericarp whilst 542 wereidentified as being predominantly expressed in the endo-sperm (see \u201cAdditional files 3 and 4\u201d).These groups of tissue-specific genes were then com-pared with a list of DEGs identified between control andhigh p.a. temperature treatments at 10 and 14daa (4981and 3652 DEGs respectively) from this same experiment.This enabled the identification of genes present in bothsets, that were therefore likely to be predominantlyexpressed in either the pericarp or endosperm andwhose expression was significantly affected by high p.a.temperature at the measured developmental stages. Ofthe 463 DEGs determined to be predominantlyexpressed in the pericarp, 166 genes were differentiallyexpressed between treatments at 10daa and 92 differen-tially expressed at 14daa, with 48 genes being differen-tially expressed between treatments at both 10daa and14daa. Out of 542 DEGs predominantly expressed in theendosperm only 7 genes were differentially expressed be-tween treatments at 10daa and 39 at 14daa, with 2 genesbeing differentially expressed at both stages.The number of DEGs between the two tissues thatwere significantly differentially expressed between 10and 14daa with a significant interaction of heat treat-ment was then determined. DEG analysis between sam-ples at 10 and 14daa performed on RNA-Seq data thathad not undergone any tissue-specific filtering revealedKino et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:170 Page 6 of 17115 DEGs which also presented significant differentialexpression between high p.a. temperature treated andcontrol samples. When compared against the tissue spe-cific pericarp and endosperm gene lists, 12 genes out ofthese 115 DEGs were predominantly expressed in thepericarp (Fig. 4), and included genes encoding lipidtransfer proteins (LTP) and a peroxidase, while only 1match was found with the list of predominantly endo-sperm expressed genes and corresponded to a memberof the seed-type vacuolar processing enzyme family.Cluster analysisA k-means clustering algorithm was performed on the463 pericarp predominant DEGs and 542 endospermFig. 4 Heat map of significant pericarp predominant DEGs between 10 andtreatment.

Therefore, the peri-carp and endosperm predominant DEGS were dividedinto 5 clusters each according to the k-means algo-rithm (Fig. 5a and b, respectively).CPM values were collected for each gene from thepericarp and endosperm predominant lists and for eachsample from the different developmental stages andtreatments. These were then log transformed.

The median log-CPM values for eachcluster were compared between high p.a. temperaturetreated and control samples at 10 and 14daa using a 2-way ANOVA. The only pericarp cluster to exhibit sig-nificant differences in expression values between controland high p.a. temperature treated samples (2-wayANOVA, f = 26.159, p = < 0.001) and between 10 and14daa (2-way ANOVA, df = 1, f = 24.20 p = < 0.001) waspericarp cluster 2, with gene expression within this clusterdown-regulated under high p.a. temperature at both 10and 14daa. However, there was no significant interactionbetween the treatment and developmental stage on geneexpression within the cluster (p= > 0.05) (Fig. 6 (a)).On the contrary, expression of genes within endo-sperm cluster 3, the only cluster to exhibit significantdifferences in expression values between treatment anddevelopmental stages, was significantly up-regulatedunder high p.a. temperature treatment (2-way ANOVA,df = 1, f = 6.98, p= > 0.001) and between 10 and 14daa(2-way ANOVA, df = 1, f = 42.35, p= > 0.001). However,as observed with pericarp cluster 2, no significant inter-action between the developmental stage and the treat-ment on the gene expression pattern was observed(p= > 0.05) (Fig. 6 (b)). For both of these clusters, the ef-fect of high p.a. temperature can be interpreted as an ac-celeration of development since it increases expressionfor pericarp cluster 2 which has a rising trend with de-velopment, and decreases it for endosperm cluster 3which has a falling trend.Gene ontology of significant pericarp and endospermclustersThe pericarp genes of cluster 2 were cross-referenced inthe Knetminer software with the user-specified searchterm \u2018cell wall\u2019. Of the 157 genes within the cluster, 120of the genes registered a relevance score on the Knetmi-ner knowledge database, with values ranging from 0.05to 544.88. The genes with the 10 highest relevancescores (highest association with the search term) in-cluded three encoding for endoglucanases within theGLU2 family, in addition to two xyloglucan endotrans-glucosylases, a gene encoding a \u03b2-EXP, and an aquaporin(Table 1). Cross referencing of 56 endosperm predomin-ant genes in endosperm cluster 3 with the term \u2018cellwall\u2019, returned relevance scores for 43 of the genes; how-ever, values ranged from 0.12 to 39.22, indicating thatFig. 6 Median Log-CPM values from a) pericarp cluster 2 and b) endosperm cluster 3, between control and high p.a. temperature treated RNA-SEQ samples at 10 and 14daa and in control treated samples at 6daa.

BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:170 Page 8 of 17the strength of the association between endosperm clus-ters 3 with the search term was lower compared to thepericarp cluster 2 genes.Gene ontology term enrichment performed on thepericarp cluster 2 and endosperm cluster 3 allowed forthe statistical determination of overrepresentation ofgenes within the sample set, deduced through compari-son against all the available potential genes containedwithin the available reference genome. The analysis thenreferences genes from the sample list against a databaseof GO-terms that represent a number of biological pro-cesses within plant development. In pericarp cluster 2,the biological process with the highest degree of geneover-representation was \u2018cuticle development\u2019 (GO id:0042335), whereas in endosperm cluster 3, genesinvolved in \u2018the killing of cells of other organisms\u2019 (GOid: 0031640) were the most significantly overrepresentedgenes.DiscussionRegulation of wheat grain weight potential by the mater-nal grain tissues during development has been previouslysuggested and investigated by other groups [10, 13, 18],but to our knowledge, this work represents the firstexample of this interaction being explored under highp.a. temperatures. Using RNA-Seq analysis and cross-referencing with existing data sets [23, Pellny publishedonline: Arrayexpress - E-MTAB-8397] we were able tobetter characterise the effect of high p.a. temperatureson the expression profiles of genes predominantlyTable 1 Knetminer output of the ten highest relevance scores of genes from pericarp specific cluster 2 cross-referenced with thesearch term \u2018cell wall\u2019. *Unknown protein encoded.Kino et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:170 Page 9 of 17expressed in either the pericarp or endosperm and relatethese genes to particular cellular mechanisms. We havefocused in particular on genes involved in cell wall re-structuring, since our driving hypothesis was that hightemperatures, when experienced p.a., would dispropor-tionally accelerate the rate of development of the peri-carp tissues compared to the endosperm, resulting in apremature decrease in the ability of pericarp cell walls toexpand. This, in turn, would limit endosperm expansion,and therefore grain size.High p.a. temperature exposure reduces mature grainweight in cv. CadenzaThe early grain filling phase (6daa-10daa) has been thefocus of previous studies investigating the effect of highp.a. temperature on wheat, with high p.a. temperaturesduring this developmental stage having been reported toresult in reductions in mature grain weight [25\u201329]. Theresults of Experiment 1, in this study, show that highp.a. temperatures applied towards the end of thecelluarisation phase of grain development (around 6daa)for 4-days or longer reduce mature grain weight inwheat, whilst a 2-day high p.a. temperature treatmentwas insufficient to produce significant differences. Thisis in contrast with the results of Talukder et al. [29],who observed a reduction in mature grain weights in 4commercial Australian bread varieties subjected to asingle day\u2019s exposure of high p.a. temperature treatment(35 \u00b0C) between 7 and 10daa, and highlights the genotypicvariability in the response of wheat cultivars to high p.a.temperatures.The results of Experiment 1 also suggest that there isnot a proportional effect between the duration of a highp.a. temperature treatment and the reduction in maturegrain weight: the reduction in mature grain weight ob-served in plants that had undergone 4-days of treatmentwas not significantly different to those observed in plantsthat experienced 6, 8, 10 and 12 days of high p.a.temperature treatment. This result supports suggestionsby Stone et al. [30] that when brief periods of high p.a.temperature occur, yield potential in wheat is decreasedby a more or less a fixed extent. The results of this ex-periment also support the findings of Nuttall et al. [31]who observed that the application of 4-days of cumula-tive exposure to a high p.a. temperature treatment of 35/15 \u00b0C from 2daa for 6 h per day resulted in 15% reduc-tion in individual grain weight in cv. Yipti and that thisreduction plateaued from this point onward with furtherdurations of treatment. Therefore, 4-days of high p.a.temperature treatment, either applied consecutively ordays apart, would represent a threshold beyond whichsensitivity to high p.a. temperature declines, and possiblysuggests that the high temperature treatment may trig-ger the imposition of a structural limit on the sink cap-acity of the grain.Although maternal tissue control of seed size andendosperm sink capacity has been well studied [17, 32],the mechanism via which this is achieved has not so farKino et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:170 Page 10 of 17been established. High p.a. temperature treatment, ad-ministrated as reported in the experiments here dis-cussed, induced significant down-regulation of pericarpgenes with a known role in regulating or modifying cellwall expansion. The down regulation of these genes ataround 10daa following the same treatment durationthat was demonstrated to result in a reduction in maturegrain weight in Experiment 1 adds further support tothe hypothesis that high p.a. temperature induces modi-fications to the expansion capability of the pericarp,which may constrain endosperm cell expansion andpresent a degree of control over final grain size andweight.High p.a. temperatures reduce the ability of the grain toaccumulate waterWater accumulation is the main driver for endospermcell expansion and grain moisture content is thereforeclosely associated with the developmental stage of thewheat grain [20, 33]. Furthermore, maximum moisturecontent of the wheat grain has been reported as a reli-able indicator of maximum grain volume [34] and,therefore, of final grain weight [35]. Our study showedthat high p.a. temperatures affects the potential for wateraccumulation in the grain: maximum grain moisturecontent was significantly lower in high p.a. temperaturetreated grains compared to control grains and this max-imum was reached 4-days earlier, at 14daa. Pericarp de-generation, detectable as a loss of greenness, has beenpreviously been shown to occur prior to the terminationof rapid net water accumulation in wheat grain [36]. Inaddition, the degeneration of the pericarp was postulatedto be causally related to the achievement of the max-imum wheat grain sink capacity, on the basis that theend of endosperm cell division and the cessation of netwater accumulation closely coincide [37].At the transcriptomic level, in this same time interval(6\u201314 daa), high p.a. temperatures induced down-regulation of genes predominantly expressed in the peri-carp and involved in cell wall expansion in grains sam-pled 10daa, prior to the stabilisation of maximum watercontent. In support of this observation, Lizana et al. [10]also reported a down-regulation in the expression ofexpansin transcripts just prior to the stabilisation ofgrain moisture content. Our result suggests that a pre-mature loss of cell wall plasticity in the pericarp underhigh p.a. temperature may be at the basis of the reducedvolumetric capacity observed in wheat grain exposed tohigh p.a. temperature.Pericarp gene expression under high p.a. temperatureStudies by Altenbach and Kothari [38] and Wan et al.[20], showed that high p.a. temperature accelerate thenormal pattern of gene expression within the wheatgrain. In our study, where treatment was applied from6daa, we observed the largest number of DEGs betweenhigh p.a. temperature treated and control samples at10daa, after only 4-days of treatment, rather than at thelater time point of 14daa. In agreement with the findingsof the above cited authors, PCA showed that high p.a.temperature accelerates gene transcription patterns asso-ciated with development, exemplified by lower PC1values (lower PC1 value = Increased developmentalstage) for high p.a. temperature treated samples thancontrol samples. Furthermore, PC2 separated controland high p.a. temperature treated samples along the Y-axis, suggesting that temperature can affect gene expres-sion by more than simply accelerating development e.g.heat stress responses.Among the DEGs, we identified 12 predominantlypericarp expressed genes showing both significant differ-ences in expression between 10 and 14daa and a signifi-cant interaction with heat treatment. These included 5LTP genes significantly down-regulated at 10daa in sam-ples exposed to high p.a. temperature, with three ofthese being subsequently up-regulated at 14daa and tworemaining at similar expression levels between the twosampled stages. LTPs are a group of highly divergent,small basic proteins involved in cutin development, celldefence, the water permeability of cell membranes andcell wall extension [39\u201341].Of the 5 genes encoding LTPs in our data, 3 ofthose genes encoded non-specific LTPs (nsLTPs), andmembers of the nsLTP family have been showed tobe responsive to one or multiple abiotic stressors(reviewed in Liu et al. [42]), including drought [43\u201346], salt [44, 45], low temperature [45, 47], and hightemperature [45]. Transcript levels for nsLTPs inwheat have been previously shown to increase fromaround 12daa until the late stages of grain develop-ment [48] under high p.a. temperatures (37/28 \u00b0C).Also in our study, nsLTPs encoding genes were sig-nificantly differentially expressed between develop-mental stages and showed a significant interactionwith temperature. We observed down-regulation ofthree nsLTPs at 10daa under high p.a. temperaturescompared to expression of these genes at 6daa and10daa under control temperatures, followed by up-regulation at 14daa. We suggest this pattern of ex-pression may reflect the multiple functions of nsLTPs:these genes may be down-regulated under high p.a.temperature conditions at 10daa, reflecting a generalreduction in pericarp cell wall extension consistentwith the role of nsLTPS as cell wall plasticisers [40],before being upregulated at 14daa in response to hightemperatures, possibly to facilitate cuticle develop-ment as part of an earlier maturation response of thegrain.Kino et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:170 Page 11 of 17PeroxidaseAnother gene differentially expressed between 10 and14daa with a significant interaction with temperaturetreatment was PER2/PER42, a gene encoding an un-specified haem-b class III peroxidase and which wasdown-regulated in high p.a. temperature treated samplesat 14daa. Class III peroxidases are secreted glycoproteinsknown to be involved in a broad range of physiologicalprocesses, including regulation of cell elongation and cellwall modification [49, 50]. They are able to promote ri-gidity of cell walls by forming strong intracellular bondsby oxidation of aromatic cell wall compounds (e.g. lig-nin), but they can also generate radical oxygen species(ROS) that can break covalent bonds in cell wall poly-mers such as hydroxyl radical (OH\u00b0) [51, 52]. As such,they perform dual functions within plant cell walls, regu-lating both cell wall stiffening and relaxation. Lipid per-oxidation under high temperatures has been reportedduring the grain-filling stage in wheat, with high temper-atures being associated with increase in membrane dam-age and decrease antioxidant levels [53]. Also in wheatthere is evidence of down-regulation of the activity ofantioxidant enzymes like peroxidases occurring underhigh temperatures [54] and exacerbating the accumula-tion of ROS. The downregulation of the PER2/PER42gene observed in our study could be linked to ROS accu-mulation under heat stress, either as a cause or aresponse.Gene ontology and functional analysisKnetminer analysisKnetminer webtool analysis with the search term \u2018cellwall\u2019 applied to the down-regulated genes within peri-carp cluster 2 identified endoglucansases, xylogluca-nase, an aquaporin and \u03b2-EXP. Endoglucanases are agroup of membrane-bound enzymes that hydrolysecell wall polysaccharides with contiguous (1, 4)-\u03b2 -gly-cosyl residues in their chain and are implicated in thebreakdown of plant cell walls during development[55]. The KORRIGAN (KOR) gene, a specialisedmember of the endoglucanases, has been shown to beexpressed in the expanding cell walls of A.thaliana[56], with one member of the KOR family, the KOR3gene, having been associated with cell wall biosyn-thesis [57]. In our study, we report the down regula-tion of three KOR3 genes in the pericarp under highp.a. temperature, which suggests a reduction in cellwall assembly in the outer layers of the grain and,consequently, in their expansion potential.Within the pericarp cluster 2 genes, the Knetmineranalysis webtool also identified members of the XTHfamily. Some XTHs have been shown to be down-regulated under drought conditions in Barley\u2019s awns[58], however no study has reported so far on theexpression of XTH genes in wheat grain under high p.a.temperature. Our data shows that whilst XTHs weredown regulated within the pericarp in both control andtreated samples between 10 and 14daa, the reduction inthe expression of these genes was greater under high p.a.temperatures, which also suggests a reduction in the ex-pansion capacity of the cell walls within the pericarp. Fi-nally, EXPB5 was also identified from the pericarpcluster 2 genes by the Knetminer webtool when search-ing with the term \u2018cell wall\u2019. EXPB5 encodes a \u03b2-EXP,belonging to a class of cell wall proteins which have pre-viously been shown to be crucial in regulating cell wallrestructuring via the disruption of hydrogen bonds be-tween cellulose microfibrils and cross-linking glycans,thus allowing cellular expansion under turgor drivenpressure [59, 60].Expression of \u03b1- EXP genes derived from wheat grainpericarp RNA has been reported to peak between 8-12daa [61] and to rapidly decline after 25daa [10]. Whilstthese studies show the importance of \u03b1-EXP genes inthe early stages of wheat grain development, there is lessinformation regarding the function and presence of \u03b2-EXPs in wheat grains in more advanced stages ofdevelopment.\u03b1 and \u03b2 EXPs make up the two largest families of EXPgenes and while they share only around 20% amino-acididentity [60], members from both families appear to de-stabilise noncovalent load bearing bonds between cellu-lose microfibrils in plant cell walls [62].OsEXPB5, a member of the \u03b2-EXP family in rice,has been showed to be involved in root hair growth[63]. While there is little information pertaining tothe specific action of EXPB5 in wheat grain cell walls,its presence in pericarp cluster 2 suggest that the ex-pression pattern of this cluster may be representativeof changes in the cell wall of the pericarp under highp.a. temperatures: down-regulation of EXPB5 between10 and 14daa is stronger in high p.a. temperaturetreated samples, suggesting a higher increase in therigidity of the pericarp cell walls of these grains com-pared to untreated samples.GO term analysisGO term enrichment for pericarp cluster 2 revealed thatthe most significant GO term was \u2018cuticle development\u2019(GO id: 0042335). The cuticle acts primarily as a perme-ability barrier involved in regulating water loss and pro-tecting plant organs from dirt, bacteria and othermicroorganisms [64]. During the early stages of anthesisthe developing wheat grain contains a number of osmo-philic cuticles or cuticular membranes but most of themare gradually removed p.a. by enzymatic degradation[65] so that only two cuticles persist in the developinggrain up to maturity: one being found on the outermostKino et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:170 Page 12 of 17layer of the grain, the outer-epidermis, and the other be-ing positioned on the surface of the nucellar epidermis.The downregulation of genes contained within peri-carp cluster 2 at 10daa in high p.a. temperaturetreated samples compared to control samples indi-cates a clear effect of high p.a. temperature treatmenton the expression of genes involved in cuticle devel-opment. Previous studies have shown that the cuticleof wheat leaves and its specific wax composition isimportant in regulating drought tolerance in differentcultivars [66]. The outer-epidermis cuticle of thewheat grain forms from around 7daa and reaches itsmaximum thickness by 17daa [65], after which it re-mains structurally unchanged until maturation, apartfrom becoming appressed to the inner cuticle. Genesinvolved in the formation of the cuticle are thereforeexpected to be down-regulated from around 14-17daaas the cuticle ends its development. We observeddown-regulation of genes contained within pericarpcluster 2 and annotated as involved in \u2018cuticle develop-ment\u2019 from 10daa in high p.a. temperature treatedsamples, which supports the hypothesis of an accelerationin the development of the pericarp under high p.a.temperature. Given the cuticle\u2019s important role in regulat-ing moisture loss in plant tissues, increased expression ofgenes involved in cuticle development might be expectedin order to reduce water losses at high temperature, but infact the opposite was observed in the form of a more rapiddecrease of these transcripts. Possibly this reflectsimportance of cuticular transpiration in cooling tissues tomaintain function.The most significant GO term derived from the genescontained within endosperm predominant cluster 3 was\u2018The killing of cells of other organisms\u2019 (GO id:0031640). The genes contained within endosperm pre-dominant cluster 3 experienced increased upregulationunder high p.a. temperatures compared to the controlsamples. Previous studies have shown a large degree offunctional overlap in defence-associated genes that re-spond to both biotic and abiotic defence mechanisms[67]. In addition, a transcriptome microarray analysis ofgrains from a Chinese bread wheat cultivar (Jimai 20),reported in Yu et al. [68] showed that genes associatedwith defence against both biotic and abiotic stresseswere all up-regulated during the grain filling period, par-ticularly between 11-15daa; the results obtained fromour experiment, whereby defence associated genes areup-regulated to a high degree between 10 and 14daa inhigh p.a. temperature treated grain are in agreementwith the above mentioned work. Therefore, it appearsthat high p.a. temperatures accelerate the expressionprofile of genes involved in cuticle development in thepericarp (down-regulated) and defence genes within theendosperm (up-regulated) between 10 and 14daa.ConclusionsThe results of the RNA-Seq analysis conducted in thisinvestigation suggest an acceleration of the expressionprofiles of select groups of genes predominantlyexpressed in either the endosperm or pericarp. In thepericarp, the expression of genes involved in the forma-tion of the cuticle and associated lipid-binding andtransport genes are significantly affected by exposure ofgrain to high p.a. temperatures with accelerated down-regulation in high p.a. temperature treated samples, sug-gesting the earlier formation of the cuticle in the outerlayers of the wheat grain. The increased up-regulation ofgenes involved in defence in the endosperm suggeststhere may be functional overlap between genes that re-spond to abiotic and biotic stress during wheat grain de-velopment and this up regulation would coincide withstructural changes to the cell wall. The down-regulationin the pericarp, under high p.a. temperature of genessuch as endoglucanases, xyloglucanases EXP and perox-idase suggests a premature loss of plasticity in the peri-carp cell walls that would coincide with a reduction ingrain moisture content and therefore in the volumetriccapacity of the endosperm. The coincident down regula-tion of these pericarp predominant genes and the earlierattainment of maximum moisture content of grainsunder high p.a. temperatures lends support to the theorythat high p.a. temperature may prematurely reduce plas-ticity in the outer layers of the grain resulting in a phys-ical restriction on the growth of the endosperm, sincemoisture content and final grain weight are closely asso-ciated. Further transcriptomic analyses from individualgrain layers under high p.a. temperature treatment andinvestigation into the levels of important cellular sub-strates such as ROS will shed further light on the effectof high p.a. temperature on the regulation of grain devel-opment and grain layer expansion.MethodsPlant material growing conditions and experimentationTriticum aestivum cv. Cadenza was used in both Experi-ment 1 and Experiment 2; seeds for these experimentswere purchased from CPB Twyford Ltd., Royston, U.K.In both experiments, seedlings were grown, individually,in 1.5 L pots containing ~ 950 g of a standard soil mix(75% medium grain peat, 12% sterilised loam, 3%medium grade vermiculite 10% sand and 3.5 kg Osmo-cote plus\u2122 per m3) in a glasshouse with additional over-head lighting set to a 16-h photoperiod (5.00\u201321.00),with the canopy receiving ~ 450 /m2/s Photosynthetic-ally active radiation (PAR). The average relative humidity(RH) of the growing period was 73% for the plants usedin Experiment 1 and 67% in Experiment 2.Four controlled environment growth cabinets (WeissTechnik\u2122 HGC 1514) were used in both experiments,Kino et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:170 Page 13 of 17with two cabinets being used for the high p.a.temperature treatment and two for the control treat-ment in each experiment. All four cabinets were on a16-h photoperiod (5.00\u201321.00) with night-time condi-tions of 70% humidity and 15 \u00b0C. In the high p.a.temperature treatment cabinets, during the light-period,RH was set at 50% whilst the temperature increasedfrom the night-time temperature to 35 \u00b0C over 4-h be-tween 5.00\u20139.00 (an increase in temperature of 0.083 \u00b0Cper minute). There was also a ramping of thetemperature at the end of each light-period, with thetemperature decreasing from 35 \u00b0C to 15 \u00b0C between19.00\u201321.00 h (a temperature decrease of 0.166 \u00b0C perminute). Therefore, the high p.a. temperature treatment(35 \u00b0C) was imposed for 10 h per day. The two controlcabinets had the same light-period RH as the high p.atemperature treatment cabinets but with a light-periodtemperature of 18 \u00b0C with no ramping of thetemperature between night and day. Average amount oflight provided was ~ 550 /m2/s PAR at the canopy levelin both sets of cabinets.For the application of the high p.a. temperature treat-ments, plants were grouped into differently sized cohortsin both experiment 1 and 2, with cohorts consisting ofplants that had all reached anthesis on the same day.These cohorts acted as blocks in the experimental designof each experiment (a diagram explaining the experi-mental design is provided as \u201cAdditional file 5\u201d). Anthe-sis was defined as the moment when the middle third ofthe ear of the primary tiller of a plant had anthers pro-truding. In Experiment 1 a randomised block design wasused with 8 blocks comprised of 7 plants and 7 treat-ments. The 7 plants of each block were grown in theglasshouse until 6daa, after which they were transferredinto the controlled environment growth cabinets. Oneplant from each block was transferred to one of the twocontrol treatment cabinets with the remaining 6 plantsfrom each block being transferred as a group to one ofthe two high p.a. temperature treatment cabinets. These6 plants in the high temperature treatment cabinets hadeach been randomly assigned a treatment duration of ei-ther 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12-days. Following an assigned highp.a. temperature treatment duration, each plant was thentransferred to the control treatment cabinet until themaximum 12-days of high temperature treatment withinthe block had been completed. Then the whole blockwas returned to the glasshouse and grown until matur-ity. Once they had reached maturity, grains were col-lected for yield data determination.In Experiment 2, a randomised block design was used,with 4 blocks consisting of 14 plants in total, with 7plants being used for the high p.a. temperature treat-ment and 7 being used as the control. In total there were5 treatments. All plants within each block were grown inthe glasshouse until 6daa before being transferred to ei-ther the high p.a. temperature treatment cabinets or thecontrol treatment cabinets. Plants within the cohortshad previously been randomly allocated to one of 7 p.a.collection points (4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26daa). Plants allo-cated to 4 and 6daa collections were sampled whilst inthe glasshouse, before the high temperature was applied,in order to obtain an early development measurement ofgrain moisture content. Each individual plant was sub-jected to one treatment and one collection in order toremove any potential effects of cumulative collection.The use of 4 cohorts provided 4 individual plant repli-cates for each treatment and collection time. Grainswere collected from the outside 2 florets (2nd and 4thfloret) on the central eight spikelets of the ear of themain tillers, resulting in 16 grains being collected in totalfrom each plant. All experimental research containedwithin this submission complied with institutional, na-tional and international guidelines.Mature grain weight analysisIn order to determine the average weights of maturegrains in Experiment 1, grains collected from primaryheads were counted and weighed collectively. The totalweight was then divided by the number of grains perhead in order to give an average individual grain weight.Developing grain average dry weight and grain moisturecontent analysisThe 16 developing grains collected from each stage perplant in Experiment 2 were weighed before being frozenin liquid nitrogen and transferred to a \u2212 80 \u00b0C freezer.Frozen grains were then freeze-dried for a 4-day periodbefore being weighed again in order to determine thetotal combined grain dry weight. Average grain mois-ture, average grain dry weight and average percentagemoisture content of grain were also calculated as fol-lows: mc% = ((sample fwt \u2013 sample dwt)/fwt)*100, wheresample fwt is the average fresh weight of a grain andsample dwt is the average grain weight of the same sam-ple after drying.RNA extractionTotal RNA was extracted from freeze-dried material col-lected at 6, 10 and 14daa in Experiment 2, i.e. samplesthat had received 0, 4 and 8 days of temperature treat-ment respectively. Two extractions were performed ongrain samples collected at 6daa, and three extractionswere performed for each of the two treatments (hightemperature/control) at the two further collection points(10 and 14daa) with 14 RNA extractions performed intotal. Total RNA was extracted from samples via phe-nol/chloroform extraction as detailed in Singh et al. [69].RNA purification and DNA removal was performedKino et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:170 Page 14 of 17prior to resuspension of the RNA pellet using a Qiagen\u2122RNAse free DNase kit (79254).CDNA library preparationThe RNA samples were sent to the Earlham Institute(Norwich, UK) where they underwent additional testing,according to their quality control pipeline for RNASequencing. The integrity of the 14 RNA samples wasanalysed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100\u2122 before be-ing confirmed as suitable to be run on an IlluminaHiSeq 2500\u2122 sequencer at a read metric of 2x125bp(paired-end reads) and with an expected output of 13\u201316 million reads per sample. Adapter dimer was re-moved from the most affected libraries before librarieswere pooled together. The concentration of the pooledlibraries was then validated via q-PCR which matchedclosely to concentrations obtained via Qubit. Therefore,in total, 14 samples proceeded to sequencing (2x6daa,3x10daa (control), 3x10daa (treated), 3x14daa (control),3x 14daa (treated).RNA-Seq data analysisRNA-Seq reads from grain samples were mapped againstthe T.aestivum genome using the TGACv1 gene assem-bly produced by the Earlham Institute [70]. Read dataunderwent fastqc [71], and trimmomatic [72], in orderto remove adapters before undergoing gene alignmentusing the alignment program for mapping HISAT2, [73].RNA-Seq data from existing studies by Pearce et al. [23]and Pellny (published online: Arrayexpress - E-MTAB-8397), were also uploaded to the galaxy platform used asreference data sets for comparison.Following mapping of the reads obtained from theRNA-Seq analysis, the number of reads that werealigned uniquely to each gene within the genome werecounted using the featurecounts programme [74] in theR data analysis package [75]. The data were then nor-malised to account for variation in sequencing depthusing the edgeR Bioconductor software package [76] andlog counts per million (Log-CPM) was used as the meas-ure of gene expression [77].Comparative analysis between RNA-Seq samples wasperformed using the Rstudio statistical software package[75] using the advanced linear model function to identifygenes that were differentially expressed between treatedand control samples at the different developmentalstages. All differential gene expression analysis was per-formed using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05. Thenumber of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) wasidentified between the three sampled developmentalstages independent of treatment using pairwise compari-sons also via. The edgeR statistical programme [76].PCA analysis was performed using the DESeq2 Biocon-ductor software package [78].Tissue specific expressionIn order to determine gene expression specific to an in-dividual grain tissue, the RNA-Seq data collected fromRNA extracted from whole grains were compared withdata sets relative to specific grain tissues. Filtering wasinitially performed on the Pearce et al. [23] dataset byselecting DEGs with an expression value higher than 5counts per million (CPM) in the tissue with the highestexpression and an 8 log-fold change between the peri-carp and endosperm. The list of pericarp predominantDEGs were also compared with RNA-Seq data obtainedfrom dissected pure starchy endosperm collected at17daa by Pellny, (published online: Arrayexpress - E-MTAB-8397) in order to confirm that none of the genesdetermined to be predominantly expressed in the peri-carp were also expressed in endosperm. DEGs deter-mined to be from the pericarp that had a measure ofexpression of more than 40 reads in 80 million in thestarchy endosperm data list were assumed to be non-specific to the pericarp and were therefore discarded.One hundred seventy-five DEGs from the list of pericarppredominant DEGs met this threshold, reducing thenumber of pericarp predominant DEGs from 638 to 463.In order to visualise patterns of gene expression, rela-tive expression heat-maps were produced using z-scorescaling and global clustering in order to group geneswith similar expression profiles (Figs. 4, 5, 6). To scalevia \u2018z-scores\u2019, read counts for a gene from the sampleshad the mean calculated and then subtracted from eachsample score for that gene. The standard deviation wasthen calculated before each data point was divided bythis standard deviation.K-means cluster analysisCPM values were collected for each gene from the peri-carp and endosperm predominant list of DEGs from theRNA-Seq analysis performed in this experiment and logtransformed. The median of the log-CPM values foreach of the five clusters from both the pericarp andendosperm were calculated in each sample and thisvalue was used as measure for gene clusters.Gene ontology analysisFunctional analysis of the genes within each cluster wereperformed using the Knetminer\u2122 web tool developed bythe Bioinformatics department of Rothamsted ResearchInstitute [79]. GO term enrichment using Blast2GO\u2122[80] was also performed on identified gene clusters. Inthe analysis, the reference genome used in the RNA-Seqanalysis of this experiment (TGAC_v1.) [71] was com-pared against the genes within determined clusters usingFischer\u2019s exact test.Kino et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2020) 20:170 Page 15 of 17Statistical analysisGrain weight and moisture content statistical analyseswere performed using Genstat\u2122 17th edition [81]. Datawere analysed via ANOVA: to analyse controlled envir-onment material a blocking structure of cohort/cabinet/position of the cohort within the cabinet/position of thepot within the cabinet position/pot number was used.Comparison of gene cluster average CPM values wascompleted using a statistical analysis add-on in Micro-soft Excel and selecting a 2-way ANOVA to compareclusters between treatments and developmental stages.Significant differences between results were determinedby obtaining the least significant differences (LSDs) ofthe means between data and comparing this against thesample means. Where the difference between comparedsample means was greater than the LSD value of themeans, this was taken to indicate a significant difference(p = < 0.05) and vice versa with differences between sam-ples means lower than the LSD value of the means.Additional FilesAdditional File 1.

In this paper we consider the cone of all positive, bounded oper-ators acting on an infinite dimensional, complex Hilbert space, and examinebijective maps that preserve absolute continuity in both directions. It turnsout that these maps are exactly those that preserve singularity in both di-rections. Moreover, in some weak sense, such maps are always induced bybounded, invertible, linear- or conjugate linear operators of the underlyingHilbert space. Our result gives a possible generalization of a recent theoremof Molnar which characterizes maps on the positive cone that preserve theLebesgue decomposition of operators.1. IntroductionThroughout this paper H will denote a complex infinite dimensional Hilbertspace, unless specifically stated otherwise, with the inner product (\u00b7 | \u00b7). The sym-bols B(H) and B+(H) will stand for the set of all bounded operators and the coneof all positive operators, respectively. Motivated by their measure theoretic ana-logues, Ando introduced the notion of absolute continuity and singularity of positiveoperators in [1], and proved a Lebesgue decomposition theorem in the context ofB+(H). Since then similar results have been proved in more general contexts, weonly mention a few of them: [6, 7, 9, 14\u201316].Given a mathematical structure and an important operation/quantity/relationcorresponding to it, a natural question to ask is: how can we describe all maps thatrespect this operation/quantity/relation? Such and similar problems belong to thegradually enlarging field of preserver problems, the interested reader is referred tothe survey papers [5, 10, 11] for an introduction. A considerable part of preserverproblems is related to operator structures, for which we refer to the book of Molna\u00b4r[12] and the reference therein.In this paper our goal is to generalize Molna\u00b4r\u2019s result [13, Theorem 1.1] about thestructure of bijective maps on B+(H) that preserve the Lebesgue decomposition in2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Molna\u00b4r proved that the cone is quite rigid in the sense that thesemaps can be always written in the formA 7\u2192 SAS\u2217with a bounded, invertible, linear- or conjugate linear operator S : H \u2192 H. Anatural question arises: how can we describe the form of those bijections that pre-serve absolute continuity (or singularity) of operators in both directions? Clearly,this is a weaker condition than that of Molna\u00b4r, hence maps considered by Molna\u00b4robviously preserve this relation. However, it is not too hard to construct othermaps which preserve absolute continuity. For example, one could use the fact thatevery positive operator is absolutely continuous with respect to every invertible el-ement of B+(H), and that invertible elements are the only ones with this property.Therefore, if we leave all positive and not invertible operators fixed, and consider anarbitrary bijection on the subset of invertible and positive operators, then this mappreserves absolute continuity in both directions. Despite the existence of such seem-ingly unstructured maps, it is still possible to describe all maps with this weakerpreserver property.2. Technical preliminariesWe say that a bounded linear operator A : H \u2192 H is positive if (Ax |x) \u2265 0holds for all x \u2208 H. This notion induces a partial order on B+(H), that is, A \u2264 Bif B \u2212A \u2208 B+(H). Two positive operators A,B \u2208 B+(H) are said to be singular,A \u22a5 B in notation, if the only element C \u2208 B+(H) with C \u2264 A and C \u2264 B is thezero operator. It turns out that this relation can be phrased in terms of the rangesof the positive square roots (see [1, p. 256]):(2.1) A \u22a5 B \u21d0\u21d2 ranA1/2 \u2229 ranB1/2 = {0}.Next, A is said to be B-dominated if there exists a c \u2265 0 such that A \u2264 cB. If Acan be approximated by a monotone increasing sequence of B-dominated operatorsin the strong operator topology then, we say that A is B-absolutely continuous,and we write A\u001c B. Observe that this definition of absolute continuity combinedwith the Douglas factorization theorem [2, Theorem 1] yieldsA\u001c B =\u21d2 ranA \u2286 ranB,however, the converse implication is not true in general (see e.g. [14, Example 3]). Acharacterization of absolute continuity by means of operator ranges reads as follows(see [1, Theorem 5]):(2.2) A\u001c B \u21d0\u21d2 {x \u2208 H : A1/2x \u2208 ranB1/2} is dense in H.If B has closed range, then the range-type characterization of absolute continuitytakes a much simpler form:(2.3) A\u001c B \u21d0\u21d2 ranA \u2286 ranB, provided that ranB = ranB.In this paper we are going to investigate singularity and absolute continuitypreserving bijections. We say that a bijective map \u03d5 : B+(H)\u2192 B+(H) preservesabsolute continuity in both directions ifA\u001c B \u21d0\u21d2 \u03d5(A)\u001c \u03d5(B) for all A,B \u2208 B+(H).MAPS PRESERVING << AND \u22a5 OF POSITIVE OPERATORS 3Similarly, we say that a bijection \u03d5 : B+(H) \u2192 B+(H) preserves singularity inboth directions ifA \u22a5 B \u21d0\u21d2 \u03d5(A) \u22a5 \u03d5(B) for all A,B \u2208 B+(H).To formulate our results, we need some further notation. With calligraphicletters we always denote linear (not necessarily closed) subspaces of H and we usethe symbol Lat(H) for the set of all subspaces. A special subset of Lat(H) formedby operator ranges is denoted byLatop(H) := {M \u2286 H : \u2203 S \u2208 B(H), ranS = M} = {ranA1/2 : A \u2208 B+(H)},where the second identity is due to the range equality(2.4) ranS = ran(SS\u2217)1/2 for all S \u2208 B(H).It is known that Latop(H) forms a lattice and that Latop(H) $ Lat(H), for moreinformation see [4].For every positive integer n we set Latn(H) and Lat\u2212n(H) to be the set of alln-dimensional and n-codimensional operator ranges, respectively:Latn(H) :={M \u2208 Latop(H) : dimM = n}={M \u2208 Lat(H) : dimM = n},Lat\u2212n(H) :={M \u2208 Latop(H) : codimM = n}.Observe also that Lat\u2212n(H) consists of all n codimensional closed subspaces of H.We use the symbol Bn+(H) to denote the set of all bounded positive operators withn dimensional range. We also introduce the following subset of B+(H) which isassociated with an operator range M \u2208 Latop(H):R1/2(M) :={C \u2208 B+(H) : ranC1/2 = M}.Note that R1/2(M) is never empty according to (2.4).3. Main TheoremIn this section we state and prove our main result. We give a complete descriptionof bijections that preserve absolute continuity in both directions, and of those thatpreserve singularity in both directions. It turns out that these maps have the samestructure.Theorem A. Let H be an infinite dimensional complex Hilbert space and assumethat \u03d5 : B+(H) \u2192 B+(H) is a bijective map. Then the following four statementsare equivalent:(i) \u03d5 preserves absolutely continuity in both directions,(ii) \u03d5 preserves singularity in both directions,(iii) there exists a bounded, invertible, linear- or conjugate linear operator T :H\u2192 H such that(3.1) ran\u03d5(A)1/2 = ranTA1/2 for all A \u2208 B+(H),(iv) there exists a bounded, invertible, linear- or conjugate linear operator T :H \u2192 H and a family {ZA : A \u2208 B+(H)} of invertible positive operatorssuch that(3.2) \u03d5(A) = (TAT \u2217)1/2ZA(TAT \u2217)1/2 for all A \u2208 B+(H).4 GYO\u00a8RGY PA\u00b4L GEHE\u00b4R, ZSIGMOND TARCSAY, AND TAMA\u00b4S TITKOSProof. (i)=\u21d2(ii): Notice that (i) implies \u03d5(0) = 0, since 0 is the only element inB+(H) which is B-absolutely continuous for all positive operator B. Moreover, itis easy to see that we have A \u2208 B1+(H) if and only if{C \u2208 B+(H) : C \u001c A,A 6\u001c C} = {0},hence \u03d5(B1+(H)) = B1+(H). Assume that \u03d5 satisfies (i) but not (ii), hence thereexist A,B \u2208 B+(H) such that A \u22a5 B but \u03d5(A) 6\u22a5 \u03d5(B). In particular, this meansthat there exists a non-zero vector f \u2208 H such that f\u2297f \u2264 \u03d5(A) and f\u2297f \u2264 \u03d5(B),and hencef \u2297 f \u001c \u03d5(A) and f \u2297 f \u001c \u03d5(B).Since f \u2297 f = \u03d5(e\u2297 e) holds with some non-zero vector e \u2208 H, we obtaine\u2297 e\u001c A and e\u2297 e\u001c B.But this implies e \u2208 ranA1/2 \u2229 ranB1/2, hence A 6\u22a5 B, which is a contradiction.(ii)=\u21d2(iii): The first step is to reformulate the singularity preserving propertyin terms of operator ranges. For any positive operator A we define the setA\u22a5 := {C \u2208 B+(H) : C \u22a5 A}.From (2.1) it follows easily thatA\u22a5 = B\u22a5 \u21d0\u21d2 ranA1/2 = ranB1/2 for all A,B \u2208 B+(H).Consequently, \u03d5 satisfies(3.3) ranA1/2 = ranB1/2 \u21d0\u21d2 ran\u03d5(A)1/2 = ran\u03d5(B)1/2for all A,B \u2208 B+(H). We introduce the following map:\u03a6 : Latop(H)\u2192 Latop(H), \u03a6(ranA1/2) := ran\u03d5(A)1/2,which is obviously well-defined and bijective. From (2.1) and (3.3) it is immediatethat \u03a6 preserves \u201czero intersection\u201d in both directions, i.e.,M \u2229N = {0} \u21d0\u21d2 \u03a6(M) \u2229 \u03a6(N) = {0}.Next, our task is to understand \u03a6. We easily see thatM \u2286 N \u21d0\u21d2 {K \u2208 Latop(H) : K \u2229N = {0}} \u2286 {K \u2208 Latop(H) : K \u2229M = {0}} ,and thus \u03a6 preserves inclusion in both directions:(3.4) M \u2286 N \u21d0\u21d2 \u03a6(M) \u2286 \u03a6(N).In particular this implies that \u03a6({0}) = {0} and \u03a6(H) = H. Notice that we havedimM = 1 \u21d0\u21d2 {N \u2208 Latop(H) : N \u2286M} = {{0},M} ,hence the restriction \u03a6|Lat1(H) is a bijection of Lat1(H) onto itself. Similarly, wehavedimM = 2 \u21d0\u21d2 {N : N $M} \u2286 Lat1(H) \u222a {{0}},therefore \u03a6|Lat2(H) : Lat2(H) \u2192 Lat2(H) is also a bijection. Combining theseobservations, we conclude that \u03a6|Lat1(H) is a projectivity, that is, \u03a6 maps any threecoplanar elements to coplanar elements. Therefore the fundamental theorem ofprojective geometry (see e.g. [3]) can be applied: there exists a semilinear bijectionT : H\u2192 H such that\u03a6(M) = T (M), for all M \u2208 Lat1(H).MAPS PRESERVING << AND \u22a5 OF POSITIVE OPERATORS 5Now, we examine how \u03a6 acts on a general M \u2208 Latop(H) \\ {0}. By the aboveproperties, for all N \u2208 Lat1(H) and M \u2208 Latop(H) we haveN \u2286M \u21d0\u21d2 T (N) \u2286 \u03a6(M)andM \u2229N = {0} \u21d0\u21d2 T (N) \u2229 \u03a6(M) = {0}.Therefore, for all M \u2208 Latop(H) \\ {0} we have\u03a6(M) =\u22c3T (N)\u2286\u03a6(M),T (N)\u2208Lat1(H)T (N) =\u22c3N\u2286M,N\u2208Lat1(H)T (N) = T\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed \u22c3N\u2286M,N\u2208Lat1(H)N\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 = T (M),hence, by the definition of \u03a6 and T we obtain that\u03d5[R1/2(M)] = R1/2(T (M)) for all M \u2208 Latop(H).All that remains is to prove that the semilinear map T is either linear- or conju-gate linear, and bounded. It is immediate that T and T\u22121 map one-codimensionallinear manifolds into one-codimensional ones. Furthermore, a finite codimensionalsubspace of H is an operator range if and only if it is closed, so we infer that T mapsLat\u22121(H) onto Lat\u22121(H). Since H is infinite dimensional, we can use [8, Lemma 2and its Corollary] to conclude that T is either linear- or conjugate linear. Finally,to show that T is bounded it suffices to prove that y\u2217 \u25e6 T is bounded for everybounded linear functional y\u2217 \u2208 H\u2217. Suppose first that T is linear. Since T mapsLat\u22121(H) onto Lat\u22121(H), there is x\u2217 \u2208 H\u2217 such that ker y\u2217 = T (kerx\u2217). Conse-quently, kerx\u2217 = ker(y\u2217 \u25e6 T ), which implies y\u2217 \u25e6 T = \u03bbx\u2217 for some \u03bb, and hencey\u2217 \u25e6 T is bounded. A very similar approach applies when T is conjugate linear.(iii)=\u21d2(iv): First, assume that T is linear. Then by (2.4) we obtain(3.5) ran\u03d5(A)1/2 = ranTA1/2 = ran(TAT \u2217)1/2 for all A \u2208 B+(H).Hence by [4, Corollary 1 on p.259] we have \u03d5(A)1/2 = (TAT \u2217)1/2XA with someinvertible operator XA \u2208 B(H). Therefore (3.2) clearly holds with ZA = XAX\u2217A.Assume now that T is conjugate linear. Consider an arbitrary antiunitary oper-ator U : H\u2192 H. Thenran\u03d5(A)1/2 = ranTA1/2 = ranTA1/2U = ran(TAT \u2217)1/2for all A \u2208 B+(H), where in the last step we used (2.4) for the linear boundedoperator TA1/2U . From here we finish the proof as in the linear case.(iv)=\u21d2(i): By (2.4) we haveran\u03d5(A)1/2 = ran(TAT \u2217)1/2Z1/2A = ran(TAT\u2217)1/2 = ranTA1/2 = ranTA1/2T \u2217for all A \u2208 B+(H). Thus by [4, Corollary 1 on p.259], there exists an invertibleoperator YA \u2208 B(H) such that\u03d5(A)1/2 = TA1/2T \u2217YA.If we introduce the notation DA,B := {x \u2208 H : A1/2x \u2208 ranB1/2} for every pairA,B \u2208 B+(H), then an immediate calculation shows thatD\u03d5(A),\u03d5(B) = (T\u2217YA)\u22121(DA,B)from which it follows that DA,B is dense if and only if D\u03d5(A),\u03d5(B) is dense. By (2.2)this implies (i). \u00036 GYO\u00a8RGY PA\u00b4L GEHE\u00b4R, ZSIGMOND TARCSAY, AND TAMA\u00b4S TITKOS4. The finite dimensional caseIf dimH < \u221e, then Lat(H) = Latop(H), every operator has closed range, andranA = ranA1/2 holds for all A \u2208 B+(H). Therefore the notions of absolute conti-nuity and singularity simplify considerably. In particular, the characterization (2.3)of absolute continuity is valid for every pair A,B of positive operators. Similarly,the range characterization of singularity reduces toA \u22a5 B \u21d0\u21d2 ranA \u2229 ranB = {0}.Furthermore, we have R1/2(M) = {C \u2208 B+(H) : ranC = M} for all M \u2208 Lat(H).Therefore the finite dimensional version of Theorem A can be proved much moreeasily using the fundamental theorem of projective geometry provided that dimH >2. However, we point out that the result we get is slightly different, as T is notnecessarily linear- or conjugate linear anymore. We omit the proof.Theorem B. Let H be a complex Hilbert space such that 3 \u2264 dimH < +\u221e andlet \u03d5 : B+(H) \u2192 B+(H) be a bijective map. Then the following three statementsare equivalent:(i) \u03d5 preserves absolutely continuity in both directions,(ii) \u03d5 preserves singularity in both directions,(iii) there is a semilinear bijection T : H\u2192 H such thatran\u03d5(A) = ranTA for all A \u2208 B+(H).Finally, in case when dimH = 2, the fundamental theorem of projective geom-etry cannot be applied. However, one can prove easily that points (i) and (ii) areboth equivalent with the following condition:(iii\u2019) \u03d5(0) = 0, \u03d5 maps the set of all invertible positive operators bijectively ontoitself, and there is a bijection \u03a8: Lat1(H)\u2192 Lat1(H) such thatran\u03d5(A) = \u03a8(ranA) for all A \u2208 B1+(H).AcknowledgementWe would like to thank the referee for his/her helpful comments on the paper.References[1] T.

It is wellestablished that cancer cells are genetically and phenotypicallyheterogeneous; however, the extent to which this phenotypicvariation is heritable is far less well explored. Here, we estimatethe broad-sense heritability (H2) of two cell traits related tocancer hallmarks\u2013\u2013cell motility and generation time\u2013\u2013withinpopulations of four cancer cell lines in vitro and find that motilityis strongly heritable. This heritability is stable across multiple cellgenerations, with heritability values at the high end of thosemeasured for a range of traits in natural populations of animalsor plants. These findings confirm a central assumption of cancerevolution, provide a first quantification of the evolvability of keytraits in cancer cells and indicate that there is ample raw materialfor experimental evolution in cancer cell lines. Generation time, atrait directly affecting cell fitness, shows substantially lowervalues of heritability than cell speed, consistent with its havingbeen under directional selection removing heritable variation.1. IntroductionEvolutionary processes are acknowledged to play a significant rolein the initiation and progression of cancer, as well as in theacquisition of traits such as chemotherapy resistance [1\u20133].Cancer evolution as a field rests on the reasonable, but rarelydirectly tested, assumption that a variety of cellular traits linkedto cancer development and progression are heritable at the levelof the cell population: that is, there is phenotypic variationbetween cancer cells, and that at least some of that variation isdue to factors passed on from mother cell to daughter cell, ratherthan being caused by environmental factors such as nutrientavailability. For example, explaining the evolution of metastaticroyalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR.Soc.OpenSci.7:1916452behaviour in terms of dispersal or foraging ecology requires that cells should vary heritably in theirdispersal behaviours [4], and models of intra-tumour competition [5], by definition, assume aheterogeneous population with heritable differences between cells. The heterogeneity of cancer cells,whether in tumours or laboratory cell lines, is well established\u2013\u2013for instance, a recent multi-omics studyfound high levels of both genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity between different populations of HeLacells [6]. Using microfluidic devices, it has also been possible to induce and measure migration of singlecells [7] (Yan & Irimia 2014) and to isolate subpopulations for analysis, between which stablephenotypic differences are seen [8,9]. However, heritability\u2013\u2013which is defined in quantitative genetics asthe proportion of trait variance in a population that is due to genetic variation, and which determinesthe response to selection [10]\u2013\u2013has never been directly measured for any trait in cancer cell populations.Drastic reductions in the cost of sequencing technology over recent years have provided the cancerresearch community with an abundance of genome sequence data, including at a single-cell level [11].Sequence analysis techniques adapted from population and evolutionary genetics can detect andmeasure evolutionary processes in tumours [12], and signatures of natural selection can be detectedby various methods including comparing synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates [13],or estimating the relative contributions of neutral and adaptive evolution using distributions of allelefrequencies within tumours [14]. However, while such analyses can show natural selection hasoccurred and sometimes identify target genes, they are not always informative as to which phenotypictraits are the targets of selection. Researchers increasingly recognize the need to complement sequencedata with a clear and quantitative understanding of cell phenotypes, and\u2013\u2013where possible\u2013\u2013to linkgenotype to phenotype [15]. Theoretical models and simulations of cancer evolution, both populationlevel and agent based, will undoubtedly guide this programme of phenotypic research [16], but theseapproaches could be even more valuable if informed by cell-level observational data.Based on observations of cancer cells over multiple cell generations, we here present cell-levelphenotypic data that allows us to estimate broad-sense heritability (H2) of two traits within fourclonally reproducing cancer cell lines. Generation time\u2013\u2013the time elapsed between cell divisions\u2013\u2013isclosely linked to cell fitness. Cell motility is a key step toward metastasis, but confers an uncertain[17,18], and likely context-dependent [19], selective advantage.Both generation time and cell motility are observable and quantifiable using time-lapse videomicroscopy (figure 1a). Cell lineages must be observed over several generations to give reliableestimates of heritability, because cytoplasmic factors cause transient similarity between sister cells forseveral hours after cell division [20], which will inflate estimates. There is also the possibility thatsoon after cell division, over short spatial scales, sister cells could affect one another\u2019s behaviour viasecreted signals, further increasing the similarity between sister cell pairs. We therefore estimate H2based on several different cell\u2013cell relationships. By tracking and comparing second-generation clonaldescendants of the same progenitor cell (\u2018cousin cells\u2019; figure 1b), which have never directly sharedcytoplasm, we can provide the estimates of H2 that represent stably inherited differences betweenclonal lineages.2. Material and methods2.1. Cell linesAll cell lines used were laboratory adapted. Three are adenocarcinoma in origin: MCF7 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-22\u2122) [21], MDA-MB-231 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-26\u2122) [22] and HeLa (ATCC\u00ae CCL-2\u2122) [23]. HT1080 (ATCC\u00aeCCL-121\u2122) [24] are fibrosarcoma derived. Cell lines were grown as a monolayer in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C inminimum essential media containing 10% foetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mMglutamine. MCF7, HT1080 and HeLa cell media also contained 1% non-essential amino acid solution.Passage numbers were 15\u201318 for MCF7, 41\u201344 for MDA-MB-231 and 5\u20138 for both HeLa and HT1080cells. Typical laboratory cell culture maintains cell lines at population sizes of 105 to 106.2.2. Time-lapse microscopy and lineage trackingIn total, 9025 cells were tracked, giving a dataset of 471 573 cell positions at known time points. For eachof 59 time-lapse videos taken, a haemocytometer was used to plate 5000 cells per well onto a 24-wellplate. Six wells per cell line were distributed around the plate. Five points within each well werechosen at random and images were taken every 20 min over 72 h with a Nikon TiE Time Lapsemother/daughter cellssister cellscousin cellstimeHT1080HeLa30201000 10 20MCF7daughter curvilinear speed (\u00b5m h\u20131 )daughter curvilinear speed (\u00b5m h\u20131 )30 20 40406020MDA\u2013MB\u20132316020 40406020005 10 15 20 2505101520250mother curvilinear speed (\u00b5m h\u20131)60(b)(a)(c)100 \u00b5mmother curvilinear speed (\u00b5m h\u20131)Figure 1.

(c) Example of parent\u2013offspring regression for motility, shown herefor the mother cell/daughter cell relationship, in all four cell lines tested. Each point represents a mother cell and the meanspeed of her daughters, and the slope of the regression line is the estimate of broad-sense heritability. Note that axes differbetween graphs due to differences in speed between cell lines. As the cells reproduce clonally, the same method is applicableto other cell\u2013cell relationships. H2 values for all cell\u2013cell relationships are shown in table 1.royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR.Soc.OpenSci.7:1916453royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR.Soc.OpenSci.7:1916454system. NIS software was used to convert images into a video file for each point. ImageJ and MtrackJ[25,26] were used to analyse videos, recording cell positions at each timepoint and cell divisionevents. Our final dataset consisted of cell families: groups of related cells for which we had whole-lifespan data on cell motility and generation time over three cell generations (figure 1b). 2048individual cells (22.7% of cells originally tracked) could usefully be included in our analysis, in thatthey were members of cell families in which it was possible to compare at least one pair of \u2018cousincells\u2019. These comprised 52 families for the cell line MCF7, 141 families for MDA-MB-231, 134 familiesfor HeLa and 110 families for HT1080.2.3. Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed in R [27]. The generation time for a given cell is the time taken for a fullcell cycle from cytokinesis to cytokinesis. Cell motility was calculated as the curvilinear speed of a cellover its entire individual lifetime: the total Euclidean distance of the path travelled from cell divisionto cell division, in microns, divided by its generation time in hours. All cells included in our analysiswere observed for a complete cell cycle; the cells originally plated were therefore excluded, as werethose that moved off-screen, died or had not divided by the end of the tracking period. For thisreason, some cell families contained fewer than six cells. We could detect no significant differences incell speed between families containing different numbers of cells, and there was also no significantdifference in cell speed between individual cells that moved off-screen compared to those that weretracked until division (t-tests, p > 0.05 in every cell line for each test). While it is still possible that wehave failed to track some proportion of faster cells that were more likely to move off-screen over thetracking period, these results suggest that such an effect is unlikely to be large. There was also nosignificant difference between wells (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test; p > 0.05), suggesting that spatial effects\u2013\u2013which could exacerbate similarities between related cells and inflate estimates of heritability\u2013\u2013areminimal. We then estimated broad-sense heritability as the slope parameter of a simple least squaresregression of trait values between clonal cells and their relatives, for all three cell\u2013cell relationships(figure 1c); that is, our estimate of H2 is Cov(x, y)/Var(x) where our x and y values are the speeds ofpairs of related cells. Where a cell had multiple tracked daughters or \u2018cousins,\u2019 their mean value wasused. This is a modification of standard parent\u2013offspring regression techniques [28] for determiningheritability in clonally reproducing cell families and provides a straightforward way to compareheritability values calculated from different cell\u2013cell relationships; the structure of our dataset, withsome wells containing very few families, made this a more appropriate method of analysis than alinear mixed model.3. Results and discussion3.1. Cell motilityFor all four cell lines, and for all cell\u2013cell relationships considered, the broad-sense heritability (H2) ofmotility is highly significant (figure 1c; table 1). Values of H2 ranged from 0.45 to 0.84, which is highcompared to that of a range of traits in natural [29,30] and agricultural [31] populations. Although noone statistic adequately describes evolvability, this result does imply that cancer cell populationscontain substantial variation for motility on which natural selection could act. Mutations, stableepimutations, or both may contribute to this heritable variation [32], and potentially to evolutionarychange [33].3.2. Generation timeGeneration time shows avery different pattern of heritability (table 1). For all lines and all cell relationships,H2 values are lower than those for motility. There is no consistent relationship between the two traits: intwo cell lines, faster dividing cells were slower moving (for HeLa, Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 =\u22120.068; p < 0.001; forMCF7, \u03c1 =\u22120.178; p < 0.005); in HT1080, faster dividing cells were faster moving (\u03c1 = 0.072; p < 0.005)and no significant correlation was seen in MDA-MB-231 (\u03c1 =\u22120.002; p > 0.1).Apart from in the HeLa cell line, only sister\u2013sister heritability is consistently significant for generationtime, consistent with variation in this trait being attributable to transient cytoplasmic or nutritionaldifferences, or perhaps secreted signals\u2013\u2013the MDA-MB-231 cell line shows only marginally significantTable1.Meantraitvalue(\u00b1standarddeviation)andbroad-senseheritabilityofmotilityandgenerationtime,infourcelllines,forthreerelationshipsbetweencellsintrackedclonalfamilies.R2isalsogivenforeachregression.celllineno.offamiliesmeanspeed(\u00b5mhour\u22121 )meangenerationtime(hours)heritabilityofcellmotilityH2(R2 )heritabilityofgenerationtimeH2(R2 )sister:sistermother:daughtercousin:cousinsister:sistermother:daughtercousin:cousinMCF75210.76\u00b13.7424.78\u00b15.880.5\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.28)0.46\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.33)0.58\u0001\u0001(0.27)0.49\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.35)0.15(0.01)0.27(0.03)MDA-MB-23114126.82\u00b111.3722.46\u00b16.620.82\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.65)0.59\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.55)0.56\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.41)0.47\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.23)0.10(0.00)0.27\u0001(0.06)HT108011037.55\u00b110.0314.22\u00b14.150.62\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.44)0.45\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.3)0.56\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.3)0.45\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.11)0.15\u0001(0.02)0.26(0.02)HeLa13412.48\u00b15.2324.43\u00b14.460.82\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.6)0.69\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.61)0.85\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.60)0.56\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.27)0.4\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.08)0.62\u0001\u0001\u0001(0.36)\u0001 p<0.05,\u0001\u0001 p<0.01,\u0001\u0001\u0001p<0.001.royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR.Soc.OpenSci.7:1916455royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR.Soc.OpenSci.7:1916456H2 for generation time between cousins. As the low R2 values indicate, the regression model explainedthe data poorly, suggesting there may be other factors not included in our model which would explainmore of the variation.Differences in heritability between traits could have a variety of causes: traits are likely to vary insensitivity to environmental factors, and contributing genes may show different levels of standingvariation. Generally, however, lower values of heritability might be expected for traits such asgeneration time which are highly correlated with fitness, as genetic variation is likely to be removedby natural selection [34]. Conversely, selection can maintain phenotypic variation as well as remove it,and one might expect to see high heritability of traits under fluctuating or frequency-dependentselection\u2013\u2013which, under some models of evolution, would include motility traits.The cell lines MCF7 and HeLa are both highly genetically unstable, showing extensive genomerearrangement [35], high levels of chromosome number variability [36] and many instances ofregional copy number increase [37]. Such cell lines might be expected to show higher H2 values, andgreater evolvability, due to a greater level of standing genetic variation. This was not borne out forMCF7 in our data, although HeLa did show high H2 values compared to the other cell lines tested.3.3. Conclusions and future directionsOur results confirm an important but previously untested assumption of cancer evolution [38,39] and areencouraging for the prospect of experimental cancer evolution in vitro, an emerging field that isbeginning to provide new insights into cancer biology and evolution [40\u201342] in the same way asmicrobial experimental evolution has advanced our understanding of adaptation more generally [43].Similar methods could be used to estimate evolvability parameters in a range of traits, such as celladhesion or extracellular matrix degradation, and a range of cell populations. It would be interestingto compare a range of cancer types with differing tendencies to metastasis\u2013\u2013perhaps includingtransmissible cancers\u2013\u2013and cancers from different patients, including recently isolated lines andbiopsy samples. Primary non-cancerous cells should also be tested: currently, beyond a few measuresof proliferation rate and marker gene expression in Chinese hamster ovaries [44], very sparse data areavailable on the extent of heritable phenotypic variation between clonal somatic cells of multicellularanimals, despite this question being highly relevant to the evolution of multicellularity [45]. Yan et al.[7] measured the speed of individual cancer cells (including MCF-7 cells) in microfluidic channels andreported no correlation between the speeds of sister cells; the discrepancy between their results andour own may be because our statistical analysis was more sensitive, or due to differences inexperimental method, such as the use of collagen coating, or the fact that in their experiment, cellswere responding to self-generated ECF gradients in fine capillaries, whereas in ours, the liquidmedium that covered the cells was able to mix more freely and might not have sustained sharp gradients.Good data on trait heritability are available for a few model species of unicellular eukaryotes. Broad-sense heritability estimates obtained for 46 growth traits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [46] had a medianvalue of 0.77, and in Neurospora crassa, the heritability of six clock traits [47] ranged from 0.42 to 0.87.However, both of these experiments started with crosses between geographically disparate strains tomaximize genetic variation. We obtain similar heritability estimates within individual clonal cell lines,suggesting that cancer cells undergo comparatively rapid phenotypic diversification.Gene expression data from cells with varying trait values within the same cell line, or comparisonsbetween selection and control lines after experimental evolution, could reveal possible targets ofselection. Little is currently known about the molecular basis of phenotypic variation within tumours,although molecular genetic variation is known to be substantial [48,49].Because heritability is affected by the levels of environmental variation [50], values of heritabilityin vivo are likely to differ from in vitro estimates. Further quantitative data on cancer cell populationseither in culture conditions simulating particular conditions of interest in tumour microenvironments,or within real tumours, are needed to enable the evolutionary dynamics of cancers to be understoodand translated into meaningful in vivo predictions for personalized medicine and to reveal new targetsand therapies for future clinical interventions.Data accessibility.

There-fore, identifying new YR resistance genes and their associated molecular makers is of greatinterest in breeding programs using marker assisted selection [4, 5]. Two major YR resistancegenes, Yr5 and Yr7, were identified in wheat and mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2B[6, 7]. Intercrossing Yr5 and Yr7 near-isogenic lines (NILs) in the genetic background of Avo-cet S (AVS) revealed distinct segregation patterns for each gene, indicating probable allelism.This hypothesis was confirmed by a recent study which showed that Yr5 and Yr7 are distinctPLOS ONEPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231157 April 15, 2020 1 / 16a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111OPEN ACCESSCitation: Gardiner L-J, Bansept-Basler P, El-SodaM, Hall A, O\u2019Sullivan DM (2020) A framework forgene mapping in wheat demonstrated using theYr7 yellow rust resistance gene.

Sequence data underlyingmapping-by-sequencing is now available from theEuropean Nucleotide Archive repository (at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena), study PRJEB36010.Phenotype data has been made available viaSupplementary S3 Table (Avalon x Cadenza DHyellow rust scores following seedling infection withisolate Pst08/21, the \u201cSolstice\u201d race, avirulent onYr7) & S4 Table (YR-GWAS Panel yellow rustscores following seedling infection with the sameparalogues arranged in a complex tandem cluster [6]. Both are a valuable source of resistance,Yr5 being effective against the pathogen in most wheat growing regions of the world [8] andYr7 being effective under various environmental conditions including high temperature [9].Genetically dissecting complex responses such as stripe rust resistance is regularly achievedby the analysis of trait-marker associations via QTL and/or genome wide association (GWA)mapping [10,11]. While traditional QTL mapping using bi-parental populations is more power-ful, GWA mapping can potentially offer higher mapping resolution, as it benefits from historicrecombination events and linkage disequilibrium (LD) [12]. However, GWA mapping can suf-fer from false positives, leading to false associations, and false negatives, missing true associa-tion. Therefore, combining QTL with GWA mapping is increasingly attracting researchers tobenefit from both approaches [13]. Recently, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies,e.g. mapping-by-sequencing (MbS), has evolved as a new approach to explore trait-marker asso-ciation with greater resolution via developing well-distributed genic and non-genic SNPs [4,14]. MbS can be combined with bulked segregant analysis to speed the identification of candi-date genes [15]. Typically QTL, GWA mapping or MbS define a genetic interval that can con-tain multiple candidate genes dependent on the resolution of the approach, these candidatescan then be refined using homology if candidate genes are known in other species or relatedtraits (demonstrated here) or via knockout using methods such as EMS or gene editing.Here, we take advantage of using both bi-parental and GWA mapping populations, pheno-typed for severity of infection following inoculation with a pure Pst isolate avirulent on Yr7.Both populations were genotyped with the same high-density iSelect SNP array to show therelative power and precision of these population types in locating Yr7. We go on to show thatusing mapping-by-sequencing of resistant and susceptible bulks from the bi-parental popula-tion we can identify an overlapping interval to that defined by QTL analysis and GWA. Inaddition, we can populate the Yr7 interval with a much higher density of polymorphismsincluding a series of SNPs from an NBS-LRR gene which would make a logical positional andbiological candidate. Performing mapping-by-sequencing of resistant and susceptible bulksusing the recent wheat reference genome sequence (RefSeqv1) we show the power of anordered reference genome. With no prior knowledge of the gene of interest here, we demon-strate that we can refine a genetic interval of 60Mbp containing 589 genes, only 0.55% of thehigh confidence genes in the genome. Furthermore, with limited information regarding genefunction, e.g. in this case our candidate is likely to be an NBS-LRR, we were able to define acandidate gene list of only 10 genes. Our methodology is therefore broadly applicable for map-ping genes associated with a wide variety of traits. Finally, given that wheat is hexaploid, it wasnotable that our method is perfectly capable of distinguishing between the homoeologs, identi-fying a clear peak on chromosome 2B that is absent from 2A and 2D.Materials and methodsPlant materialsAvalon x Cadenza doubled-haploid population. The population of doubled haploid(DH) individuals, derived from F1 progeny of a cross between cultivars \u2018Avalon\u2019 and\u2018Cadenza\u2019, was developed by Clare Ellerbrook, Liz Sayers and the late Tony Worland (JohnInnes Centre), as part of a Defra funded project led by ADAS.

Three hundred and ten winter wheat varieties released between 1990 and 2009were selected to comprise the core wheat YR-GWAS panel. An additional 9 older winter varie-ties were included in the YR-GWAS panel based on their importance in the pedigrees of elitewheat germplasm. The full wheat YR-GWAS panel is therefore composed of 319 wheat varie-ties, mainly elite UK winter wheat varieties, but other European countries are also represented.Rust phenotyping and the seedling tests. Puccinia striiformis (Pst) isolate 08/21 (alsoknown as \u201808/21 Solstice\u2019) virulent on Avalon and avirulent on Cadenza was obtained fromAmelia Hubbard at the UK Cereal Pathogen Virulence Survey at NIAB. This isolate was usedto screen both the AxC DH population and the YR-GWAS panel. The full virulence profile ofPst \u201808/21 Solstice\u2019 is as reported in S4 Table of [17]. Seeds were sown in 96 cell trays, organizedin complete randomized block design. Once sown, the trays were placed in a disease-free glass-house or a growth room prior to inoculation. When the seedlings were between GS11 andGS12, the average height of the seedlings was recorded and plots with average seedling size lessthan 5 cm, limited seedling number with less than 3, or discoloration were discarded. Follow-ing the measurements, the trays were well watered and placed in individual polythene bags. A1:19 spore: talc mixture was prepared and then 3g of the mixture per tray, equivalent to 0.15gspores and 2.85g of talc, was distributed in an individual glass jar. Using air-blown spore inoc-ulators, each tray was inoculated individually with the contents of a jar. Bags were then sealedand placed in an incubator at 8\u02daC, 24 to 48 hours, in the dark to keep a high humidity leveland provide favorable conditions for spore germination. After the incubation, the seedlingtrays were removed from their bag and placed in a growth room. Two experiments were car-ried out using the YR-GWAS panel with 2 replications each and one experiment was donewith 3 replicates for the AxC DH population. Symptom assessment for the three experimentswas carried out at 17 days post inoculation (dpi). The variety Victor was placed in each tray asa susceptible control and to help choosing the most suitable scoring date. The infection typewas assessed on the first leaf of the seedling twice independently at 17 dpi for consistency. Dis-ease assessments followed the 0 to 9 infection type (IF) scoring system described by [18]. Lineswith an average IF score < 4 were classified resistant, with IF score 4\u20136 were interpreted asintermediate response, and with IF>6 were considered susceptible; however for DNA poolconstruction, more stringent cutoffs of< = 2 for the resistant pool and> = 7 were chosen forthe susceptible pool (S1 Table).90k iSelect SNP genotyping. The wheat 90k Illumina iSelect SNP array [19] was used togenotype both populations. In case of the AxC DH population, the iSelect mapping data wasderived from [19], whereas genotyping of the YR-GWAS panel revealed 26,015 SNPs.QTL mapping using DH population. Only SNPs on linkage group 2B, i.e. 353 SNPs,which had been scored and were polymorphic in both the AxC and YR panel were used forQTL mapping of seedling test using QTL library in GenStat 17th edition (VSN International,Hemel Hempstead, UK). Default settings of single trait linkage analysis, i.e. 10 cM step size,minimum cofactor proximity of 50 cM, 30 cM minimum separation of selected QTL, and athreshold calculated using Li and Ji option [20] with alpha = 0.05, corresponding to -log10(P)values of 3.9, were used. The QTL was mapped based on interval mapping followed by tworounds of composite interval mapping using cofactors. Finally, to estimate the allelic effect andthe explained phenotypic variance, a final QTL model was run.Association mapping using YR-GWAS panel. Kinship matrix and principal componentswere calculated using Genomic Association and Prediction Integrated Tool (GAPIT) statisticalpackage in R software [21, 22]. Association mapping was performed using the GAPIT packagein R [22] using compressed mixed linear model (CMLM) approach that account for popula-tion parameters [21].PLOS ONE Bread wheat mapping-by-sequencing for Yr7 disease resistancePLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231157 April 15, 2020 3 / 16Gene enrichment combined with mapping-by-synteny. Resistant and susceptible bulkswere created by pooling equal amounts of DNA of 51 individuals with an infection score of>= 7 (referred to as the yr7 bulk) and 54 individuals scoring < = 2 (referred to as the Yr7 bulk).At cost of a potential small loss in genetic resolution, lines with intermediate scores (2.1\u20136.9)were omitted from the bulks to ensure that phenotyping errors did not dilute the allelic dis-crimination potential of the bulks.We used the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ in solution custom capture probe set (~110 Mb) toenrich genomic DNA from the two bulk segregated pools along with the purebred Avalon andCadenza parental lines. The design and targets of the capture probe set that is used here is aspreviously reported [23]. The final design covered the majority of the wheat genes with eachprobe intended to enrich all 3 homoeologous gene copies in hexaploid wheat. The sampleswere paired end sequenced using Illumina HiSeq technology as follows; Genomic DNA waspurified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Samples were quantifiedusing a Qubit double-stranded DNA Broad Range Assay Kit and Qubit fluorometer (LifeTechnologies). 2.6\u03bcg of genomic DNA, in a total volume of 130\u03bcl, was sheared for 3\u00d760s usinga Covaris S2 focused-ultrasonicator (duty cycle 10%, intensity 5, 200 cycles per burst using fre-quency sweeping). The size distribution of the fragmented DNA was assessed on a BioanalyserHigh Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent). 50\u03bcl (~1\u03bcg) of sheared DNA was used as input for librarypreparation. End-repair, 30-adenylation, and adapter ligation were performed according to theIllumina TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation Guide (Revision B, April 2012) without in-linecontrol DNA and without size-selection. Amplification of adapter-ligated DNA (to generatepre-capture libraries), hybridisation to custom wheat NimbleGen sequence capture probes,and washing, recovery and amplification of captured DNA were all carried out according tothe NimbleGen Illumina Optimised Plant Sequence Capture User\u2019s Guide (version 2, March2012), with the exception that purification steps were carried out using Agencourt AMPureXP beads instead of spin columns. Final libraries were quantified by Qubit double-strandedDNA High Sensitivity Assay and the size distribution ascertained on a Bioanalyser High Sensi-tivity DNA chip. The 4 libraries were then pooled in equimolar amounts based on the afore-mentioned Qubit and Bioanalyser data. Sequencing was carried out on two lanes of anIllumina HiSeq 2000, using version 3 chemistry, generating 2 x 100bp paired end reads.The pipeline and algorithm for the processing of this sequencing data is summarized belowand in Fig 1; it is adapted from a previously described analysis [4, 23]. The reference genomethat was implemented to map the sequence data was the Chinese Spring hexaploid wheatRefSeqv1 genome assembly [24]. These chromosomal pseudomolecules represent the A, B andD diploid sub-genomes of hexaploid wheat individually resulting in an effectively diploid ref-erence genome of 21 chromosomes [24, 25]. The sequence data was mapped to the pseudomo-lecules using the mapping software BWA [26]. A minimum mapping quality score of 10 wasimplemented and any non-uniquely mapping reads, duplicate reads or unmapped sequencingreads were removed from the analysis.SNP calling was carried out on the mapped datasets using Samtools mpileup [27] andthen VarScan variant detection [28]. SNPs were scored at a minimum quality of 15 and a mini-mum depth of 10X in Avalon and Cadenza and 20X in the bulk segregant datasets due to theirrelative average depths of coverage (see results). A maximum depth of 200 was applied and aminimum alternate allele frequency of 10% was used for SNP calls (Table 1). Parental homoeo-logous homozygous SNPs were called if the SNP allele was observed in 80% or more of thesequencing reads with the reference allele seen in the remainder of the reads. HomozygousSNPs were designated as Avalon- or Cadenza-specific alleles if the homozygous SNP allele wasnot observed in other parent at that position resulting in 70,895 Avalon and 73,224 Cadenzaspecific homozygous alleles.PLOS ONE Bread wheat mapping-by-sequencing for Yr7 disease resistancePLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231157 April 15, 2020 4 / 16A mapping-by sequencing mutant identification pipeline and homozygous haplotypingalgorithm that we presented in a previous study [4, 23], were applied here for the analysis ofYr7 and yr7 bulks (Fig 1B). Of the Avalon specific homozygous alleles, in regions with a mini-mum of 20X coverage, 53,658 were seen in the Yr7 bulk and 60,008 in the yr7 bulk at the sameposition, regardless of homozygous or heterozygous status.

The scoring algo-rithm was then implemented to calculate a homozygote score per Xbp window along eachpseudo-chromosome at Xbp intervals for these alleles that were found in the bulks and werespecific to either the Avalon or Cadenza parents.

Fig 2 shows the CIM QTL trace for chromosome 2B, where it can be noted that theconfidence interval spans 29.16 cM. The already large confidence interval, though it spans just10% of the genetic length of chromosome 2B, contains ~50% of all 2B AxC SNPs and thus islikely to span an enormous physical interval characterized by low recombination rates, whichposes a major challenge for the fine mapping of Yr7.Genome-wide association mapping reveals historic recombination in theYr7 regionIn order to gain information on how widespread Yr7 is in UK winter wheat germplasm, to seethe expression of the gene in adult plants grown in the field and to attempt fine-mapping ofthe Yr7 gene by another means, the YR Panel of mainly UK winter wheat varieties, whichincludes both \u2018Avalon\u2019 and \u2018Cadenza\u2019 as members, was inoculated both in seedling and inadult plant field tests with Pst 08/21. The single significant hit obtained when iSelect SNPsscored in the YR Panel were scanned for association with resistance to Pst 08/21 was locatednear the centromere on chromosome 2B. The SNP showing the highest probability of associa-tion (wsnp_Ex_c10071_16554911) in the GWAS scan is located at 112.9 cM, close to the peakof the QTL interval shown in Fig 2. Closer examination of SNP haplotypes formed by a subsetof 46 SNPs informative in both the YR Panel and the AxC population, and located between107.9 and 119.1cM (see Fig 3) shows that although the yr7 susceptible haplotype representedby \u2018Avalon\u2019 (green shading where \u2018Avalon\u2019 allele is present) predominates (251/329) over theTable 1.

Vertical lines delineating seven recombination \u2018blocks\u2019 have been inserted to highlightwhere multiple distinct and independent haplotypes show blocks of SNPs, presumably in astate of identity-by-descent, have undergone historical recombination. This historic recombi-nation is useful as it allows us both to partly resolve map order, as in the sub-division of SNPsco-segregating in AxC at position 109.24cM into Blocks 2\u20134, and to tentatively rule out all butBlock 6 as potentially carrying the causal gene, since each of the other Blocks have both fully\u2018Cadenza\u2019 and fully \u2018Avalon\u2019 partial haplotypes in association with susceptibility to Pst 08/21.The notion that graphical genotypes as displayed in Fig 3 have arisen through identity-by-descent in an ancestral recombining population is supported by pedigree analysis whichexplains 11 out of 17 suspected occurrences of Yr7 in terms of vertical transmission of haplo-types 25 and 26 through known pedigrees. Haplotype 25 is possessed by varieties Brock, Taraand Vault belonging to the same lineage and Haplotype 26 is shared by three separate lineages(1: Tonic, Cordiale, Spark, Cadenza; 2: Ekla, Vector; 3: Thatcher, Tommy).

To focus on the targeted regions for enrichment only, reads were aligned to thesequences that were used for the capture probe set design, known as the capture probe design-space. It was observed that ~95% of this reference was mapped across the four datasets with anaverage depth of coverage of approximately 45X in Avalon and Cadenza and 80X in the poolsYr7 and yr7 (Table 1). Since the capture probe design-space contains one representative copyof each set of three homoeologous wheat genes this translates to ~15X coverage per wheat sub-genome in Avalon and Cadenza and ~25X per sub-genome in the pools Yr7 and yr7 for thetargeted regions.A mapping-by-sequencing mutant identification pipeline and algorithm that we presentedin a previous study [4, 23], was here, applied successfully to a new target (Fig 1). Homozygotescores were calculated for a range of windows 100,000\u201310,000,000bp along each chromosomalpseudomolecule at 10,000bp intervals for the homozygous Avalon and Cadenza specific allelesthat could be found in the bulks. The highest signal:noise ratio was obtained when homozygotescores were calculated per 10,000,000bp window at 10,000bp intervals and these scores wereplotted for each bulk in relation to both parents in Fig 4.Fig 3.

The peak interval is shownin greater detail in Fig 5. This is likely to represent our Yr7 resistance interval of interest as thesignal for the yr7 pool in Cadenza is low, as is the signal for Yr7 in Avalon (Fig 3B and 3C).The homozygosity scores successfully highlight mirrored \u2018Cadenza\u2019-specific and \u2018Avalon\u2019-spe-cific peaks in the respective Yr7 and yr7 bulks on chromosome 2B with low signal across therest of the genome. The peak interval encompasses the region from approximately633,430,001\u2013734,910,001bp on chromosome 2B (homozygosity scores>1e35) which for Yr7contains 1,262 \u2018Cadenza\u2019-specific SNPs and for yr7 823 \u2018Avalon\u2019-specific SNPs. Fig 5 highlightsmultiple individual peak regions that make up the apparently single observed peak in Fig 4; thefragmentation of the signal across disjointed nearby segments is likely a product of the exomecapture strategy that was used for sequencing with the multiple peaks representing unevensequence coverage focused primarily on genic sequence. The highest scoring individual peakregions for Yr7 Cadenza represent the intervals 633,430,001\u2013663,920,001bp, 681,790,001\u2013693,030,001bp and 702,660,001\u2013721,190,001bp (total of 60,260,000bp with homozygosityscores>1e40). There are 589 high confidence genes observed in these regions.BLAST analysis was used to infer common features with the sequence (SNP)-based AxCgenetic map and the Chinese Spring based RefSeqv1. 296 iSelect SNP sequences from theYr7 interval were used in a BLAST search against RefSeqv1 to find their relative positions (E-value > = 1e-5, minimum length 50bp, minimum sequence identity 90%). 277 iSelect SNPsFig 4.

The relative homozygosity scores (Cadenza/Avalon specific scores) for these iSelectSNP positions were extracted for each of the Yr7/yr7 datasets and plotted in Fig 5E. Fig 5Eshows that the vast majority of Yr7-linked iSelect SNP positions on chromosome 2B (216 or87.8%), fall within the peak region 633,430,001\u2013734,910,001bp that we identified using map-ping-by-sequencing. We noted that the 5 SNPs that we previously found in our candidategenetically defined interval \u2018Block 6\u2019 (Fig 3), all showed high Yr7 Cadenza specific (>1E+36)and yr7 Avalon specific homozygosity scores (>1E+16) but also low Yr7 Avalon specific (<6)and yr7 Cadenza specific homozygosity scores (<1) that are characteristic of the Yr7 locus.Furthermore, the 5 SNPs were found in the 10.3 Mbp interval 683,029,160\u2013693,314,916bp onchromosome 2B.Fig 5.

The candidate window encompassed 589high confidence genes, 10 of which are annotated as disease resistance associated and aretherefore candidate genes for Yr7 resistance (Table 2). The 10 genes are mainly clusteredtogether in the region 683,043,955\u2013686,815,417bp (~4Mbp). In a previous study a candidateYr7 gene was suggested and its gene sequence reported [6]. We used BLAST to align this Yr7gene sequence to the Chinese Spring RefSeqv1.1 where its top hit was to the homologTraesCS2B01G488000 (alignment length 433bp, score 1630, e-value<0.01 and identity 81%).This gene is also seen in the peak interval that was defined here and is one of only 10 of thegene candidates that we report in Table 2. There are 9 homozygous Cadenza specific alleles inthe Yr7 bulk in this gene TraesCS2B01G488000 (in a minimum of 70% of the sequencingreads), of which, 4 are predicted to be non-synonymous resulting in codon changes (Table 3).These are potential markers for the Yr7 gene against a Chinese Spring background. Interest-ingly, there were no homozygous Avalon specific alleles in the yr7 bulk in this gene, althoughTable 2. Candidate genes.

Therefore, it appearsthat Avalon matches Chinese Spring closely in this region.The 5 SNPs that we previously found in our candidate genetically defined interval \u2018Block 6\u2019that showed the highest\u2013log(P) scores in the GWA scan (Fig 2), were found in the 10Mbp inter-val 683,029,160\u2013693,314,916bp on chromosome 2B. This interval encompasses our candidategene homolog TraesCS2B01G488000 (Table 2) that is located at 685,265,721\u2013685,270,904bp.Therefore, gene capture from the same Yr7 and yr7 bulks combined with this mapping-by-sequencing mutant identification pipeline accurately reproduced and refined the results fromthe genetic mapping analysis to an interval containing 10 genes and ultimately a strong candi-date gene. It uses a sliding window scoring algorithm to score regions of interest by prioritizinglong homozygous parental haplotypes to smooth out noise in the homozygosity signal.ConclusionsMapping of Yr7A strong body of evidence links yellow rust resistance present in the cultivars \u2018Lee\u2019 and\u2018Thatcher\u2019 (used as differential hosts) and their derivatives with the Yr7 genetic locus. Yr7 wasnamed by Macer in 1963 [29]. Pathotyping studies led to the postulation of Yr7 in French vari-eties \u2018Camp Remy\u2019 and UK varieties \u2018Tonic\u2019, \u2018Cadenza\u2019 and \u2018Brock\u2019 [3]. Yr7 has been tentativelymapped by association with QTL in several previous studies. [30] interpreted a QTL (QYR1,gwm501-gwm47) interval on chromosome2B observed in their Camp Remy x MichiganAmber RIL population as Yr7. Furthermore, the Yr7 gene was mapped to the long arm of chro-mosome 2B [7] and recently, a candidate gene validated by isolating several independent sus-ceptible mutants from the \u2018Cadenza\u2019 background [6]. Here we show the progression fromgenetic mapping to mapping-by-sequencing and the overlap of the defined intervals by eachapproach culminating with interval refinement and identification of a logical candidate geneusing mapping-by-sequencing.In this work, we are able to re-map Yr7 with great precision, identifying a set of only 10gene candidates that matched both positional and functional annotation criteria, based onlyon our own results. Comparison of this list with the published identity of Yr7 by [6] whichemerged while this work was in progress showed that in fact, our shortlist of 10 NBS-LRRscontained the \u2018Chinese Spring\u2019 homolog of Yr7, thus giving retrospective validation to ourmethod. We highlight the benefit of combining our mapping-by-sequencing approach withthe near complete wheat reference genome sequence (RefSeqv1) in refining our candidateinterval. Furthermore, this was possible even though the reference sequence is based on thevariety Chinese Spring while our trait was found in the variety Cadenza. The identification ofTable 3.

Here, we have taken yellow rust resistant and susceptible bulked dou-bled-haploid populations, performed gene enrichment and, using mapping-by-sequencing,identified a 60Mbp region on chromosome 2B that contains the Yr7 locus. The candidate win-dow encompassed 589 high confidence genes, including 10 disease resistance associated genesthat included the closest Chinese Spring homolog (TraesCS2B01G488000) of the candidateYr7 gene reported previously [6].This analysis has taken the principles demonstrated by SHOREmap [31] and applied themto polyploid wheat using a homozygote-scoring algorithm that highlights longer homozygoushaplotypes shared between the mutant parental line and the bulked dataset. This extends aproof of concept approach combining genic enrichment and a sliding window mapping-by-synteny analysis using a pseudo-genome. This was firstly carried out in the diploid wheat spe-cies T. monococcum identifying a region on chromosome 3 that was likely to contain the Eps-3Am deletion that results in early flowering [4] and later in hexaploid wheat to map the Yr6 yel-low rust resistance locus [23]. Here, this sliding window mapping-by-sequencing analysis,implementing wheat chromosomal pseudomolecules directly, has been successfully applied todefine an interval of interest in a polyploid species.Within the defined candidate gene, we were able to select homozygous alleles at positionsthat were conserved with the parental lines. This revealed a small subset of 9 Cadenza specificalleles in the Yr7 bulk, of which, 4 are predicted to be non-synonymous and are potentialmarkers for the Yr7 gene. The identification of a small genetic region containing a candidategene of interest in a hexaploid demonstrates the power of this analysis and its broadapplicability.Combining QTL, GWAS and mapping-by-synteny approaches to pinpointcandidate causative polymorphismsEach of the approaches taken has contributed something to the discovery of potential causativeSNPs underlying the Yr7 locus. The line-by-line SNP genotyping of the biparental populationprovided an ordered genome scan that treated homoeologues as distinct. The GWAS approachgave further context as to the population history of Yr7 deployment and the historical recom-bination evident in the variety panel provided more genetic discrimination than many hun-dreds more AxC lines could possibly have provided, a fact that was particularly importantgiven the unfavorable physical: genetic distance ratio found in the Yr7 interval. The nature ofthis particular YR panel i.e. the fact that it is composed purely of commercial UK winter wheatvarieties and important historic founders provides breeders with knowledge of those lineagesin which Yr7 is found and those where it is not, allowing them to pick the most appropriateYr7 donor and flanking markers to suit the objectives of the cross and the constraints of theirmarker assisted selection schemes. Finally, the mapping-by-sequencing defined a list of only10 genes of which one was the candidate gene itself and also generated additional markers forthis gene. We noted that the SNPs that we found in our candidate genetically defined intervalclosely overlapped the interval defined by mapping-by-sequencing.PLOS ONE Bread wheat mapping-by-sequencing for Yr7 disease resistancePLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231157 April 15, 2020 13 / 16Perspectives for gene cloning in hexaploid wheatAlthough the technique of mapping is by now an established method in the genetic toolbox ofspecies which boast a fully assembled genome, polyploid large-genome crop species whosegenomes have continued to evade gold standard sequencing and are expensive to re-sequenceare still problematic to work with. [32] showed the application of transcriptome re-sequencingfrom model bulks in a tetraploid species, which offered one route to the rapid saturation ofgenetic intervals defined by bulked segregants provided the target genes were expressed to anadequate level. [4] solved the issue of expression variation inherent in the transcriptome rese-quencing approach by employing exome re-sequencing for gene mapping in hexaploid wheat.In this work, we go a step further by successfully deploying a mapping-by-sequencingapproach in a hexaploid using a near complete reference genome sequence. Although thehomozygous haplotype scoring map (Fig 4) was initially created blind to knowledge of bulkcomposition or expected genomic location, it succeeded in remapping the expected intervaland in saturating the interval with parent-specific polymorphisms without significant discov-ery bias and in a manner independent of expression level of the underlying gene. The peakdetection sensitivity will depend on the validity of the consensus gene order across all homoeo-logous genomes and the gene representation in the exome capture. However, evidently this isnot an issue for the mapping of Yr7.Short lists of candidate genes or polymorphisms produced by the hybrid mapping-by-sequencing/GWAS approach demonstrated here can be subjected to validation of their func-tion in wheat. Current methods of choice include in silico TILLING (if the wild type back-ground possesses the trait of interest) [33] or gene editing of multiple homeoalleles (which canin principle be applied in any genetic background) [34].Supporting informationS1 Table.

At the same time, academia main\u2011tains an honest scepticism about these measures, tempered by methodological develop\u2011ments that aim to remedy their most evident shortcomings.True to its nature, a composite indicator is usually built to \u2018tell a story\u2019. It is thus ideally suited to identify and bring attention to a possibly latent phenomenon. For this, it is appre\u2011ciated by \u2018value entrepreneurs\u2019.1When used for policy, the unidirectionality of composite indicators is less desirable. In the context of policy analysis and negotiation, in which different options, as well as dif\u2011ferent \u2018ends in sight\u2019, are relevant, composite indicators may fall short. Ideally, different stakeholders could confront one another, armed with different measures and indicators. Could the concept of composite indicators be stretched so as to accommodate these set\u2011tings? Could one force it to tell \u2018more than one story\u2019?In this contribution, we give this concept a try based on examples.2  The Fortune of\u00a0Composite IndicatorsA recent search on Scopus performed in the summer of 2019 indicates growth in interest in composite indicators, proxied by their mention in the scientific literature. Figure\u00a01 sug\u2011gests that not only is the use of composite indicators increasing but so is the pace of their growth.The \u2018Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\u2019, prepared by Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen, and Jean\u2011Paul Fitoussi for the French president Nicolas Sarkozy (Stiglitz et\u00a0al. 2009), says that the growth in the number of statistical indicators reflects different concurring trends: improvements in the level of education, increases in the complexity of modern economies, and the widespread use of information technology.As discussed in Becker et\u00a0al. (2017), human well\u2011being and progress are areas in which composite indicators are popular, covering themes from happiness\u2011adjusted income to environmentally adjusted income, from child development to information and communica\u2011tion technology. They are also used in the analysis of innovation (Balcerzak and Pietrzak 2017a; Dutta, Lanvin and Wunsch\u2011Vincent 2018; Hausken and Moxnes 2019; \u017belazny and Pietrucha 2017), analysis of real estate markets (Ma\u0142kowska and G\u0142uszak 2016), coun\u2011tries\u2019 competitiveness (Cheba and Szopik\u2011Depczynska 2017; World Bank 2019; Kruk and Wa\u015bniewska 2017; Schwab 2019), socio\u2011economic development (Bartkowiak\u2011Bakun 2017; Mazziotta and Pareto 2016), the quality of institutions (Balcerzak and Pietrzak 2017b), sustainable development (Balcerzak and Pietrzak 2017c; Luzzati and Gucciardi 2015; Semenenko et\u00a0al. 2019), the standard of living (Greyling and Tregenna 2017; Kuc 2017), well\u2011being (Barrington\u2011Leigh and Escande 2018; Chaaban et\u00a0al. 2016; Peiro\u2011Palomino and Picazo\u2011Tadeo 2018) and many others (Aparicio and Kapelko 2019; Capecchi and Simone 1 Value entrepreneur is a term coined by Emily Barman\u2019s in \u2018Caring Capitalism\u2019, cited in Popp Berman and Hirschman 2018). Those are experts whose job is to measure social value of different measures for the purpose of investment, and whose choices are driven by \u2018communicative goals\u2019; a value entrepreneur might want to establish legitimacy, show conformity, change behaviour or justify a field.Quantitative Storytelling in\u00a0the\u00a0Making of\u00a0a\u00a0Composite Indicator 1 32019; Dinis et\u00a0al. 2019; Marozzi 2015; Mann and Shideler 2015; Michener 2015; Miro and Piffaut 2019; Rogalska 2018). Many composite indicators target issues of sustainability. In this respect, an ongoing line of inquiry is to understand why these measures seem to have little traction, e.g. in relation to their capacity to displace established indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) as measures of progress (Boulanger 2018; Popp Berman and Hirschman 2018). We return to these themes later in the paper.3  Pros and\u00a0Cons of\u00a0Composite IndicatorsAn existing handbook on composite indicators (OECD\u2011JRC 2008) lists several pros and cons of these measures (Table\u00a01).The report by Stiglitz et\u00a0 al. (2009) considers composite indexes (CIs) problematic because even when the weighting procedure is presented transparently, the normative implications of the weights are seldom spelt out or justified. Along the same lines, for Popp Berman and Hirschman \u201csuccessful quantification projects tend to hide their assumptions\u201d. The critique of CIs also feeds into the present reflection on the abuse of metrics (Muller 2018), with the example of university ranking and similar league tables standing out as controversial (Saisana et\u00a0al. 2011; Wilsdon 2016).For mainstream economics\u2014for the purpose of this paper exemplified by the World Bank\u2019s economist Martin Ravallion\u2014CIs are guilty of not being constructed on sound eco\u2011nomics. Ravallion identifies two types of indices: those built on economic theory, either Fig. 1  Search on www.scopu s.com using as search string: TITLE\u2011ABS\u2011KEY (\u201ccomposite indicator*\u201d) OR TITLE\u2011ABS\u2011KEY (\u201ccomposite index\u201d) OR TITLE\u2011ABS\u2011KEY (\u201ccomposite indices\u201d) M.\u00a0Kuc-Czarnecka et al.1 3direct monetary aggregates or based on shadow prices2; and all others, which are dismiss\u2011ively termed \u2018mashup indices\u2019\u2014a definition that Ravallion applies to existing measures, such as the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI).More, in general, the use of Economics as a master discipline to adjudicate the sound\u2011ness of any form of knowledge has suffered, after the internal discussion in economics on the role of mathematics and modelling. Initiated after the models\u2019 inability to predict the last recession (Mirowski 2013), this discussion gave birth to a new term, \u2018mathiness\u2019\u2014coined by the economist Paul Romer (2015), defined as the use of mathematics to veil positions which are in fact normative. The use of prices\u2014whether real or shadow\u2014is in itself fraught with the crucial normative assumption that socio\u2011ecological outcomes can be represented in monetary terms (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1994). Finally, doubts remain as to what constitutes a \u2018sound economic theory\u2019, given the present controversy in the profession against the prevailing economic paradigm (Reinert 2008; Rethinking Economics 2017).Indeed, we suggest that composite indicators is a field better addressed by social scien\u2011tists in general, than it is by the field of economics in particular, as we go on to discuss in the next session.4  Is a\u00a0Theory for\u00a0Composite Indicators Possible?Without being exhaustive, we mention here some important ingredients of a possible theory of CIs. To start with, the OECD\u2011JRC handbook (2008)offers ten recursive steps to build CIs, from building a theoretical framework to how to present the results, and includes Table 1  Pros and cons of composite indicators Source: OECD\u2011JRC 2008Pros Cons1. Can summarise complex, multi\u2011dimensional realities to support decision\u2011makers2. Are easier to interpret than a battery of many separate indicators3. Can assess the progress of countries over time4. Reduce the visible size of a set of indicators without dropping the underlying information base5. Thus, make it possible to include more informa\u2011tion within the existing size limit6. Place issues of country performance and progress at the centre of the policy arena7. Facilitate communication with the general public (i.e. citizens, media) and promote accountability8. Help to construct/underpin narratives for lay and literate audiences9. Enable users to compare complex dimensions effectively1. May send misleading policy messages if poorly constructed or misinterpreted2. May invite simplistic policy conclusions3. May be misused, e.g. to support the desired policy, if the construction process is not transparent and/or lacks sound statistical or conceptual principles4. The selection of indicators and weights could be the subject of political dispute5. May disguise severe failings in some dimensions and increase the difficulty of identifying proper remedial action if the construction process is not transparent6. May lead to inappropriate policies if dimensions of performance that are difficult to measure are ignored2 Economists resort to various strategies to compute costs when they are not available. For example, a shadow price can be estimated based on the estimated \u2018willingness to pay\u2019; in the absence of a market price, the value of a good or service is taken to be what people would be willing to pay for it.Quantitative Storytelling in\u00a0the\u00a0Making of\u00a0a\u00a0Composite Indicator 1 3advice on how to tackle technical choices on data selection, imputation, normalization, and aggregation. Even a cursory glance at this list is sufficient to grasp that numerous model\u2011ling assumptions are needed in these processes, not just the assignment of weights; the idea that a composite indicator can be made \u2018objective\u2019 should be put to rest. As men\u2011tioned above, \u2018telling a story\u2019 is precisely what a \u2018value entrepreneur\u2019 wishes to do. In this context, the problem may not be with the non\u2011neutrality of a measure but, rather, with its purported neutrality. The production of apparently neutral scientific fact in the context of policy is known as \u2018stealth advocacy\u2019 (Pielke 2007), meaning that this form of advocacy is hidden behind a veneer of objectivity. Following Pielke, we suggest that scientists and CI developers be clear about their normative stances, rather than courting an impossible neutrality.It is also important to note that most existing CIs suffer from technical shortcomings, especially when they are built using a linear combination of variables. For example, most indicators are built in such that the weights attached to the different variables (i) add up to one and (ii) reflect the importance of the variables. In fact, both (i) and (ii) are highly questionable, if not outright wrong. It can be proven that according to mathematical theory it is the sum of the squared weights which should be one (Becker et\u00a0al. 2017) and that the actual importance of variables in a CI may deviate from its weights considerably (Paruolo et\u00a0al. 2013). Both results owe to the theory of sensitivity analysis (Saltelli et\u00a0al. 2008), a tool used in mathematical modelling. This theory proves that the importance of a given variable is given by the square of its weight divided by the sum of all squared weights, for the ideal case of uncorrelated and standardised variables (Saltelli et\u00a0al. 2008, p. 47). For non\u2011standardised and non\u2011independent variables, the importance depends on the interplay of the relative variances and on correlation among the variables.For Paul\u2011Marie Boulanger (2014), CI can be situated at the intersection of three con\u2011ceptual movements. The first is associated with the democratisation of expertise (Carrozza 2014), the idea that more knowledge needs to be brought to bear than that provided by experts. This is close to the concept of extended peer community advocated in post\u2011normal science (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1993), in which the soundness of scientific practice is not judged simply by the peers of a given discipline but by several disciplines, because each discipline offers a different viewpoint. Laypeople with a direct stake, knowledge, or interest in the matter at hand are also involved in the process. The OECD\u2011JRC handbook insists on the need for an indicator to be co\u2011developed, possibly and ideally involving the community of those actors (individuals, institutions, countries, or regions), which are affected by the measure. This process should extend to all the stages in a CI\u2019s construction (OECD\u2011JRC 2008).The second constitutive element identified by Boulanger (2014) is CI as instrumental in the creation of a new public through a process of social discovery (Dewey 1938). Why are \u2018social discoveries\u2019 needed? For Dewey, there are \u2018publics\u2019 affected by a transaction taking place somewhere else, who need to be made aware of a problem situation\u2014e.g. the pollu\u2011tion of an aquifer, a case of air contamination, the unintended consequences of technology, and so on. In his view, the \u201cmachine age has so enormously expanded, multiplied, intensi\u2011fied and complicated the scope of the indirect consequences [\u2026] that the resultant public cannot identify and distinguish\u201d. The German sociologist Ulrich Beck later called a society thus affected by a myriad of mostly invisible threats a \u2018risk society\u2019 (Beck 1992 [1986]).In general, developing an index of, say, air quality, sustainability, the rule of law, cor\u2011ruption, or university performance can generate and mobilise new publics, at times produc\u2011ing important policy outcomes. Several recent books on the emerging field of sociology of quantification reviewed in Popp Berman and Hirschman (2018) address this issue. M.\u00a0Kuc-Czarnecka et al.1 3The third element which can be used to shed light on CI comes from Charles Sanders Peirce, the father of semiotics, and his triadic conception of the sign as a structure con\u2011necting three elements: the sign properly said (S), an object (O), and an \u2018interpretant\u2019 (I). The example reported by Boulanger (2014) is that of the African vervet monkey, which possesses a sophisticated repertory of vocal signs for signalling the presence of a predator, distinguishing a terrestrial stalker such as a leopard, an aerial raptor such as an eagle, or a ground predator such as a snake. In this case, the \u2018object\u2019 is the predator, the \u2018sign\u2019 is the cry emitted by the vervet, and the \u2018interpretant\u2019 is the collective behaviour of the monkeys in reaction to the cry, e.g. climbing up a tree if the predator is terrestrial. Thus a CI is not just a sign (a number) pointing to an issue; it also entails an interpretant, understood as the policy or social change desired or suggested by the proponents of the measure. The same Dewey (1938) made the point that any social indicator is meaningful only in the context of a desired end in sight.Boulanger enriched the analysis of indicators of sustainability and their interpretants in a subsequent work (2018) drawing from the German sociologist and systems theorist Nik\u2011las Luhmann. For Boulanger, mobilising publics with a CI is not just a matter of providing the \u2018facts\u2019. According to Luhmann, modern societies should be seen as functionally dif\u2011ferentiated, i.e. composed of several sub\u2011systems, relatively independent (law, science, the economy, the mass media, etc.). These systems may either actively develop/use indicators to influence their evolution or be influenced by them when one system is observing another system with an indicator. The problem with sustainability is thus which system is observ\u2011ing or \u2018irritating\u2019 (the word used by Luhmann) which system. Science cannot easily \u2018irri\u2011tate\u2019 e.g. the economy developing a measure of progress to replace GDP, as science and economy follow separate codes of communication, true\u2013false for science and gain\u2013loss for the economy.There are instead cases where the strength of indicators, their capacity to appear objec\u2011tive, and their addictive character, manage to impact social systems, as evidenced by uni\u2011versity league tables mentioned earlier (Saisana et\u00a0al. 2011; Wilsdon 2016).5  Frames and\u00a0Quantitative Storytelling (QST)It is a tautology that every measure of society corresponds to a frame and\u2014according to Dewey\u2014to \u2018an end in sight\u2019 as well. The use of frames in the policy discourse is a hot topic. For example, in the US, George Lakoff (2004, 2010) laments the liberals\u2019 cultural subjugation to frames developed by conservatives. In economics, Akerlof and Shiller (2015)discuss how economic actors operating in a market are forced to exploit the frames of their consumers in order to survive. This view reverses economics\u2019 (and Adam Smith\u2019s) cherished paradigm that the composition of individual selfishness in a market produces a common good. The market as the best arbiter of all negotiations is at the heart of the prevailing orthodoxy, neoclassical economics. As mentioned, this theory is at present contested (Mirowski 2013; Reinert 2008; Rethinking Economics 2017). The French legal scholar Alan Supiot (2015) sees the neoliberal creed in markets as particularly reliant on quantification, in which numbers replace laws to create a world of dystopian injustice and dysfunction.Frames are very much at the core of discussion on the use of evidence for policy (known as evidence\u2011based policy [EBP]). Dan Kahan, an expert in cultural cognition theory, stud\u2011ies how we process new knowledge in order to reinforce our existing worldviews and Quantitative Storytelling in\u00a0the\u00a0Making of\u00a0a\u00a0Composite Indicator 1 3political orientations (Kahan et\u00a0 al. 2011), so an actor\u2019s deeper knowledge reinforces\u2014rather than cures\u2014his or her polarisation.It is thus a current refrain in EBP that facts and values cannot be always be separated, e.g. when social facts are brought to bear on the design of a policy (Gluckman 2017). The present\u2014in our view disingenuous\u2014brouhaha about the end of facts and the post\u2011truth society (Flood 2016) mixes somewhat uncritically conscious strategies of confusion and manipulation\u2014as witnessed in the recent US elections\u2014with the existence of a plurality of legitimate frames around what constitutes a problem and hence a \u2018fact\u2019 in relation to the problems (Saltelli and Funtowicz 2017).In other words, one should not equate the US administration\u2019s \u2018alternate facts\u2019 with the concept of \u2018extended facts\u2019, defined in the theory of post\u2011normal science as the product of an extended peer community (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1993). An extended fact may be a loss to a constituency which has been overlooked, a fact that is not part of the set of facts brought to bear by a regulator or by the proponent of a policy.Quantitative storytelling (QST; Giampietro et\u00a0 al. 2014; Saltelli and Giampietro 2017) posits that more legitimate frames and worldviews are upheld by different social actors. Thus, QST draws attention to the fact that economic and mathematical models used in EBP are often in the form of risk analyses or cost\u2013benefit analyses. These models focus on a single framing of the issue under consideration. A classic example is when a monetary equivalent is assigned to a social or environmental good. As discussed above, in relation to the critique of Ravallion (2010), this implies a clear normative stance.In the logic of QST, the deepening of the analysis corresponding to a single view of what the issue is\u2014achieved by \u2018mathematizing\u2019 the problem \u2013 distracts from what could be alternative readings.For Ravetz (1987) and Rayner (2012), alternative frames may represent \u2018uncomfortable knowledge\u2019, which is removed from the policy discourse. Lakoff (2004, 2010) suggests that frames may be used to generate \u2018hypo\u2011cognition\u2019.Under this critical viewpoint, mathematical models\u2014or a CI in the present context\u2014can be seen as a tool for \u2018displacement\u2019 (Rayner 2012). This occurs when a model or a ranking becomes the end instead of the means, e.g. when universities monitor and manage the outcome of a ranking, rather than what happens within their walls (Saisana et\u00a0al. 2011). After stakeholders realise they are on the receiving end of a strategy of hypo\u2011cognition, their trust in the actors and institutions involved may be diminished (Saltelli and Giampi\u2011etro 2017). A fundamental problem with EBP is that stronger players have access to bet\u2011ter evidence, i.e. more data and indicators in the present context, and can use it strategi\u2011cally (Saltelli 2018). Thus, EBP is based on a power asymmetry (Boden and Epstein 2006; Strassheim and Kettunen 2014).In QST, one drops the hope that neutral, impersonal facts will prescribe a policy and suggests instead acknowledging ignorance, as to identify \u2018clumsy solutions\u2019 (Rayner 2012), which may accommodate unshared epistemological or ethical principles. Similarly, post\u2011normal science suggests \u2018working deliberatively within imperfections\u2019 (van der Sluijs et\u00a0al. 2008). The solution offered by QST is to use quantification \u2018via negativa\u2019, by testing which of the available frames runs afoul of a quantitative or qualitative analytic check, as shown in the PISA example below. QST borrows from system ecology and attempts to refute the frames if they are based on unsound inference or violate the constraints of (Giampietro et\u00a0al. 2014): (i) feasibility (can one afford a given policy in terms of external constraints, e.g. existing biophysical resources?), (ii) viability (can one afford it in the context of the internal constraints, governance, socio\u2011economic, and technological arrangements?), and (iii) desirability (will the relevant constituency accept it?). For example, in examining the  M.\u00a0Kuc-Czarnecka et al.1 3transition to a carbon\u2011free economy, one can test the availability of natural resources (lith\u2011ium, cobalt, and other minerals needed for energy storage), whether legislation promoting transition is viable, and whether the transition is compatible with existing lifestyles. An instructive test case of QST exploring the deployment of intermittent electrical energy sup\u2011ply in Germany and Spain is reported in Renner and Giampietro (2019).Perhaps the best application of the concept of QST ante litteram is an old study of how European citizens perceive the existing narratives and conflicts in the adoption of geneti\u2011cally modified (GMO) food and products (Marris et\u00a0al. 2001). Although the prevailing nar\u2011rative is that \u2018GMO food is safe\u2019 and that consumer reluctance is rooted in anti\u2011technology or anti\u2011science prejudice, Marris and co\u2011authors showed that the people interviewed did not care about the safety of GMO food but, rather, expressed concern about a totally differ\u2011ent set of issues, including:\u2022 who would benefit from these technologies\u2022 why they were introduced in the first place\u2022 whether existing regulatory authorities would be up to the task of resisting regulatory capture from powerful industrial incumbents.Quantitative storytelling, like other tools for evidence appraisal, such as sensitivity anal\u2011ysis (Saltelli et\u00a0al. 2008), NUSAP (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1990; van der Sluijs et\u00a0al. 2005), and sensitivity auditing (Saltelli et\u00a0al. 2013), can be useful for gauging and possibly decon\u2011structing existing measures. Thus, proposers of new CI should factor this danger in if they wish to anticipate criticism. They should be the first to test the relevance and robustness of their constructs, following the well\u2011known Mertonian principle of \u2018organized scepticism\u2019 (Merton 1973), in which scientists strive to falsify their own results and invite fellow scien\u2011tists to attempt such a deconstruction.In the present work, we apply the QST approach to the construction of a composite indi\u2011cator. We consider that social convergence, with its dense web of interconnected interests, policies, and outcomes, offers an ideal environment for such an experiment. The Cohe\u2011sion Policy and convergence issues are still being discussed in the policy arena (e.g. the 7th Cohesion Forum, held in Brussels 26\u201327 June 2017; European Commission 2017a, b, c, d, e), as well as in the academy (Anagnostou et\u00a0 al. 2015; Baddeley 2006; Balcer\u2011zak and Rogalska 2016; Cosci and Mirra 2017; Furkowa and Chocholata 2017; Horridge and Rokicki 2017; Pietrzak and Balcerzak 2017; Pr\u00f3chniak and Witkowski 2016; Scheurer and Haase 2017; Stanickova 2017). The role of narratives linked to the Cohesion Policy is likely to be perceived as increasingly important for mitigating the present difficulties of the European project (Applebaum 2017).6  A Previous Example of\u00a0Quantitative StorytellingQuantitative storytelling has been used in relation to the ranking of the OECD\u2011PISA study (Ara\u00fajo et\u00a0al. 2017; Saltelli 2017). We describe this work here, as it shows how the meth\u2011odology can be used to deconstruct a measure. In the test cases of the following sections a constructive use of quantitative storytelling is demonstrated.Since the publication of its first results in 2000, the Programme for International Stu\u2011dent Assessment (PISA) implemented by the Organisation for Economic Co\u2011operation and Development (OECD) has been a subject of controversy. PISA has been presented Quantitative Storytelling in\u00a0the\u00a0Making of\u00a0a\u00a0Composite Indicator 1 3by some as a measure of a country\u2019s innovation and growth potential, while others found these metrics\u2014published every 3\u00a0years with considerable media amplification\u2014irrelevant and potentially counter\u2011productive. Noticeably, the PISA dispute was the subject of a letter published in The Guardian newspaper and signed by several educationalists and scholars and of a subsequent exchange with the OECD (Meyer and Zahedi 2014; for additional ref\u2011erences, see Ara\u00fajo et\u00a0al. 2017).OECD\u2011PISA is a convenient example for discussing the importance of the issue of frames in policy, as well as some limitations in the concept of EBP.For advocates of \u2018evidence\u2011based\u2019 or \u2018informed\u2019 policy, PISA incarnates the dispas\u2011sionate, objective facts which nourish the formulation of sound policies by allowing for comparison across countries and possibly for the identification of good practices worth emulating. For opponents of this survey, the relation between PISA and economic growth represents a neoliberal framing of education policies within a context of globalisation which is perceived as unacceptable. QST showed that\u2014while international comparability is desirable\u2014more tends to be read into these ranking than the quality of evidence allows (Ara\u00fajo et\u00a0al. 2017).According to the analysis in Ara\u00fajo et\u00a0al. (2017), a number of issues emerged.(1) Over\u2011interpretation of PISA results: According to PISA supporters (Woessmann 2014), \u201cIf every EU Member State achieved an improvement of 25 points in its PISA score (which is what for example Germany and Poland achieved over the last decade), the GDP of the whole EU would increase by between 4% and 6% by 2090; such a 6% increase would correspond to 35 trillion Euro.\u201d(2) PISA scoring strongly depends upon the modelling assumption, the design of the sam\u2011ple, the choice of the items (questions) included or excluded, and the number and typology of students sampled. Previous works reviewed in Ara\u00fajo et\u00a0al. (2017) showed that shifts in the relative position of a country were attributed to the success or failure of educational policies when, in fact, they were due to different compositions of the share of students excluded from the test.(3) PISA ranking lacks uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. PISA just offers a summary and non\u2011conservative measure of the error of a country score.(4) The non\u2011availability of the full data hampers a full analysis of the sensitivity of PISA scores to modelling assumptions.(5) PISA embeds strong normative stances, foremost the fact that education is investigated as an input to growth.(6) PISA may adversely affect what is taught and might run counter to our desires concern\u2011ing what education should be about. It encourages focusing on the subset of educational topics being selected at the expense of others.(7) In measuring what it considers \u2018life skills\u2019, PISA assumes that these skills are the same across countries and cultures. All societies are bound to become \u2018knowledge\u2019 societies. However, diversity in the curriculum being taught might be a source of country\u2011specific creativity and well\u2011being.We recognise in this list many of the \u2018flags\u2019 from QST (and from sensitivity auditing as well; see Ara\u00fajo et\u00a0al. 2017), e.g. in technical shortcomings in the interpretation of analy\u2011sis, its non\u2011transparency, the non\u2011desirability of the adopted narrative, and the institutional conflicts on whether countries or a supra\u2011national organisation such as the OECD should dictate curricula. M.\u00a0Kuc-Czarnecka et al.1 3While in the example just given QST was used to deconstruct a frame, in the present work it will be used to enrich the spectrum of frames in order to test a new style of use for CI.7  First Case: Analysis of\u00a0ConvergenceAs discussed above, social convergence offers an ideal arena for testing QST. With the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, a stronger focus is placed on social performance and employment, in which what Europe needs is less division and more cohe\u2011sion, especially now, when the European Union is struggling with Brexit, a refugee crisis, a multispeed union and a populist upsurge of euro\u2011scepticism.8  Second Case: Doing Business Index (DBI)The World Bank\u2019s Doing Business Index\u2014also known as the ease of doing business score\u2014is an extremely popular CI, constructed by aggregating forty\u2011one component indi\u2011cators over ten thematic areas (World Bank 2019): 1. Starting a business. 2. Dealing with construction permits. 3. Getting electricity. 4. Registering property. 5. Getting credit. 6. Protecting minority investors. 7. Paying taxes. 8. Trading across borders. 9. Enforcing contracts. 10. Resolving insolvency.The forty\u2011one component indicators are first normalised according to a min\u2013max scheme and then aggregated through a simple average within the thematic areas to which they belong and finally into the overall index. Each of the ten areas has the same weight, and so do the individual CIs in an area.One\u2011hundred\u2011ninety countries are then ranked from the highest index value to the lowest.A Google search on \u2018world bank\u2019 and \u2018doing business index\u2019 in July 2019 yielded as many as 5290 hits, while a search on Scopus with the search strings (TITLE\u2011ABS\u2011KEY \u2018world bank\u2019 AND \u2018doing business index\u2019) resulted in fifteen documents.Quantitative Storytelling in\u00a0the\u00a0Making of\u00a0a\u00a0Composite Indicator 1 39  Methodology for\u00a0the\u00a0Convergence Analysis9.1  Composite IndicatorsThe classical approach to constructing CIs implies the assignment of variables to a given pillar (based on researchers\u2019 knowledge or experts\u2019 opinion), then the aggregation of varia\u2011bles within the pillar, and finally aggregation into a holistic CI. We follow here this popular approach.Variables used in the analysis have a different impact on social performance. Stimulants are factors that have a positive impact on the phenomenon analysed (e.g. the employment rate), while destimulants have a negative impact (e.g. the infant mortality rate). In regional research, destimulants are often transformed to stimulants based on the inversion formula:where xsijt is the value obtained as stimulant j in country (region) i in year t obtained from transforming the original destimulant xijt (the superscript s stands for stimulant), xijt is the value of destimulant j in country (region) i in year t.The inversion formula is the simplest transformation method, and it gives all the diagnostic variables the same interpretation in the sense of their impact on the phenomenon analysed, i.e. the higher the value, the better in the optic of the index.After this transformation all variables are normalised according to the formula:where min xij2005 is the minimum value of variable j in 2005. max xij2005 is the maximum value of variable j in 2005.This normalisation method enables the results to be compared and their dynamics to be analysed by providing a fixed reference point (Pawe\u0142ek 2008). In this paper, we assume that each dimension is equally important, so the CI is calculated as:where CIit is the composite indicator describing social performance in country (region) i in year t, ziqt is the composite indicator in country (region) i calculated for variables included in group q in year t, p is the number of groups.The value of ziqt is calculated as the mean average of all variables in each dimension. In this case, the higher the CI value is, the better for the phenomenon analysed.9.2  Measuring ConvergenceIn a convergence analysis of EU Cohesion Policy, several measures are customarily employed: sigma convergence, delta convergence, gamma convergence, and beta convergence.The sigma convergence concept measures gaps among time series by examining whether cross\u2011sectional variation (measured by either standard deviation, coefficient of variation, Gini index, or any other dispersion measure) decreases over time, as would be anticipated if two (1)xsijt =1xijt(i = 1,\u2026 , n; j = 1,\u2026m; t = 1,\u2026 , k)(2)x\ufffdijt =xsijt\u2212 min xij2005max xij2005 \u2212 min xij2005(i = 1,\u2026 , n; j = 1,\u2026m; t = 1,\u2026 , k)(3)CIit =1pp\u2211q=1ziqt(i = 1,\u2026 , n;t = 1,\u2026 , k) M.\u00a0Kuc-Czarnecka et al.1 3series converged (Kong et\u00a0 al. 2019). To investigate the existence of a sigma\u2011convergence trend, regression is usually used:where Vt is the coefficient of variation in the year t.The following set of hypotheses was tested:H0  V1 = V2 = Vt no sigma convergence or divergence,H1  V1 > V2 the existence of sigma convergence,H1a  V1 < V2 the existence of sigma divergencewhere V1 is the coefficient of variation in a given year, V2 is the coefficient of variation in the next year.If the estimated value of parameter \ud6fc1 turns out to be negative and statistically significant, then sigma convergence is taking place, and diversity among the objects analysed is decreas\u2011ing. In the case of a positive sign, sigma divergence occurs, i.e. diversity among entries is accelerating (Barro and Sala\u2011i\u2011Martin 1999). In some case studies, a simple plot which shows a tendency of cross\u2011sectional variance to decrease over time is taken as evidence in favour of sigma convergence (Tsionas 2002). This concept is widely used in policy literature (i.e. Euro\u2011pean Commission 2014, 2016).Gamma convergence is a concept proposed by Boyle and McCarthy (1997). It requires an examination of the change in the ranking of countries. A simple measure that captures the change in rankings is Kendall\u2019s index of rank concordance, calculated as:where C is the number of concordant pairs of countries, D is the number of discordant pairs of countries, n is the number of observations (countries).Two observations are called concording if the two members of one observation are larger than the respective members of the other observation. Two observations are said to be discord\u2011ing if the two members of one observation are in opposite order to the respective members of the other observation (Kendall 1938).If \u03c4 is closer to zero, than changes within the distribution are higher, and gamma conver\u2011gence occurs, in the so\u2011called overtaking effect. The advantage of this approach is the ability to capture dynamics and mobility among objects (Boyle and McCarthy 1997; Holzinger et\u00a0al. 2011). Gamma convergence is usually based on a comparison of the linear ordering of analys\u2011ing observations (countries, regions) based on the CI\u2019s vale. Usually it is the first and the last period of the analysis, that is taken into consideration. If Kendall tau is statistically insignifi\u2011cant or negative, one can say that gamma convergence occurs and the overtake effect can be observed.A less known concept, which is nonetheless important policy\u2011wise, is delta convergence. This concept was proposed by Heichel et\u00a0 al. (2005) and focused on decreasing distance towards an exemplary model, or a frontrunner object. Delta convergence can be measured by the Euclidean distance from the top performer:where di is the distance of country i from the frontrunner, max xijt is the frontrunner.(4)Vt = \ud6fc0 + \ud6fc1t + \ud700t(5)\ud70f =C \u2212 Dn(n \u2212 1)(6)di =\u221a\u2211(xijt \u2212 max xijt)2Quantitative Storytelling in\u00a0the\u00a0Making of\u00a0a\u00a0Composite Indicator 1 3If the sum of distances from the frontrunner is decreasing, that suggest that objects are converging. Otherwise, divergence patterns can be observed.where Df  is the sum of distances.The following set of hypotheses was tested:H0  Df1 = Df2 = Df  no delta convergence or divergence,H1  Df1 > Df2 the existence of delta convergence,H1a  Df1 < Df2 the existence of delta divergence.In the European Union, cohesion policy sigma and delta convergence are more desirable than beta convergence, as policymakers and the general public are also interested in reduc\u2011ing the disparities, not pure growth per se (Eurofound 2018; European Commission 2015). Because of this fact, beta convergence is not discussed in this paper.10  Quantitative Storytelling on\u00a0the\u00a0Convergence Test CaseWe focused on convergence at a national scale, allowing the composition of the index to vary. Different narratives are associated with different measures of convergence. As men\u2011tioned in the previous section, sigma convergence concerns a reduction in the disparities among countries, gamma convergence seeks changes in the distribution, and delta conver\u2011gence corresponds to reducing the distance from the frontrunner.Here, we test QST in the context of CI to investigate the existence of social convergence among EU countries in 2005\u20132017. Therefore, for the sake of illustration we introduce a set of new CIs, constructed by using the 24 variables that are in the European Pillar of Social Rights. Six variables describe governance and fairness, and six variables are related to health care. The data come from the European Pillar of Social Rights, Eurostat, the World Health Organization, Eurostat, and national statistical offices. In the case of missing data, we used an imputation procedure based on multiple regression (James et\u00a0al. 2017).In our research, we assumed the existence of four different stakeholder groups. Each group has a different point of view about which dimensions should be included in the CI. The starting point in our analysis is the set of variables in the European Pillar of Social Rights, grouped by category (Table\u00a02). These variables are the choice of stakeholder no. 1 (see Table\u00a03). Stakeholder no. 2 agrees with the first that those three categories are impor\u2011tant, but from her point of view, a \u2018social Europe\u2019 should include measures of govern\u2011ance and fairness. A third stakeholder thinks that governance is not relevant in social con\u2011vergence analysis and that the functioning of health care should be investigated instead. Finally, a fourth stakeholder argues that for an exhaustive social convergence analysis, and all previously mentioned dimensions should be included (see Table\u00a02).Table\u00a03 lists the variables included in each dimension. CI values were calculated using Eq.\u00a0(3). Those values were the basis for estimating sigma convergence from Eq.\u00a0(4) using an ordinary least squares (OLS) method. The results are in Table\u00a04.Table\u00a04 shows that sigma convergence occurs for stakeholders nos. 1 and 2. By con\u2011trast, stakeholder no. 3 sees more variation among countries. In addition, the diver\u2011gence among the member states is increasing (positive \ud7361 ) for stakeholders no. 3 and 4; (7)Df = \ud6fc0 + \ud6fc1t + \ud700t M.\u00a0Kuc-Czarnecka et al.1 3Table 2  Stakeholders and the dimensions they recommend including in the composite indicatorStakeholder no. 1Stakeholder no. 2Stakeholder no. 3Stakeholder no. 41.

We recall that stakeholders 3 and 4 are those who included the functioning of health care dimensions.The coefficient of variation in 2005 for different stakeholders ranges from 0.27 (stake\u2011holder no. 3) to 0.32 (Stakeholder no. 1 and 2; see Fig.\u00a02). Hence, different stakeholders may perceive the overall spread among the member states differently, depending on the relevance of social performance dimensions. During the financial crisis (2008\u20132010), divergence patterns were observed, no matter which components were used to build the CI. This proves that country differences in challenging economic conditions are grow\u2011ing. In 2014 and afterwards, a significant increase in the value of the coefficient of vari\u2011ation can be observed for stakeholders nos. 3 and 4, which is once again connected Table 4  OLS estimations of sigma convergence (Eq.\u00a0(4)) for different stakeholdersp\u2011values are in brackets\u03b10 \u03b11 R2Stakeholder no. 1 0.3491 (< 0.001) \u2212 0.0055 (0.0255) 0.3773Stakeholder no. 2 0.3305 (< 0.001) \u2212 0.0026 (0.0289) 0.3645Stakeholder no. 3 0.2313 (< 0.001) 0.0132 (0.0050) 0.5363Stakeholder no. 4 0.2585 (< 0.001) 0.0086 (0.0020) 0.5972Fig. 2  The dynamic of the coefficient of variationTable 5  Values of Kendall\u2013tau coefficient and corresponding p\u2011values\u03c4 P valueStakeholder no. 1 0.6182 < 0.001Stakeholder no. 2 0.6980 < 0.001Stakeholder no. 3 0.5556 < 0.001Stakeholder no. 4 0.5954 < 0.001 M.\u00a0Kuc-Czarnecka et al.1 3with the unfavourable situation in the health\u2011care system. Also, the perspective of stake\u2011holder no. 2, including governance and fairness, indicates the occurrence of greater variation than stakeholder no. 1, who takes only social performance into consideration.Table\u00a05 presents the results on gamma convergence. For each stakeholder, the Kendall\u2011tau measure is positive and statistically significant, which implies no evidence of gamma convergence. In other words, the ranking of countries is relatively stable, and no overlap\u2011ping effects are observed.Figure\u00a03 presents the countries\u2019 aggregated distance from the best performer. As in the case of sigma convergence, a definite increase in the distance was also observed during the economic crisis. For all stakeholder, the sum of Euclidean distances was bigger at the end of the period analysed than in the initial year. The increase in distance for stakeholders nos. 1 and 2 was around 35%, whereas it was 125% for stakeholders 3 and 4. Thus Fig.\u00a03 indicates that delta convergence did not occur over the analysed period. The findings on hypothesis testing for delta convergence, Eq.\u00a0(7), are presented in the Table\u00a06.Analysing data presented in Table\u00a06 we are not able to say whether the delta\u2011conver\u2011gence occurs or not. First of all, the parameter is statistically insignificant, and, more importantly, the coefficient of determination is extremely low. A comparatively well\u2011fitted model can be obtained for stakeholders nos. 3 and 4, for whom the estimated parameter Fig. 3  The dynamic of standardised Euclidean distance from the frontrunnerTable 6  OLS estimation for Eq.\u00a0(7) for 27 European Union countriesThe p\u2011value is in brackets\u03b10 \u03b11 R2Stakeholder no. 1 18.8463 (< 0.001) 0.0335 (0.9100) 0.0012Stakeholder no. 2 16.8488 (< 0.001) 0.0342 (0.8791) 0.0021Stakeholder no. 3 13.0741 (0.0028) 1.4868 (0.0054) 0.5206Stakeholder no. 4 12.6301 (0.0007) 1.1961 (0.0051) 0.5255Quantitative Storytelling in\u00a0the\u00a0Making of\u00a0a\u00a0Composite Indicator 1 3was statistically significant and positive, indicating that delta divergence occurs. Therefore, it can be argued that adding variables related to health care affected the overall results. The significant and increasing differences among EU countries in health\u2011care organisation, well\u2011being and poverty, and disease prevention may have an impact on an already weak\u2011ened European Union. Furthermore, they substantiate the notion of a union with many speeds.While the European project experiences an objective moment of difficulty, it is notice\u2011able that situation appears better when the \u2018official set\u2019 of convergence measure is used (stakeholder no.1) than when other sets of variables meeting different concerns (fairness, health) are included. The tension between the official set and the antagonist sets discussed here is artificial, but these situations exist in practice. One illuminating example is a con\u2011troversy between the French representatives of the trade unions (and their militant experts) and the statistical office INSEE about how to measure poverty in France. Bernard Sujo\u2011bert recounts this episode in the volume Stat\u2011activisme: comment lutter avec the nombres (Bruno et\u00a0al. 2014). Noticeable in this story \u2013 involving a new statistical measure known as  BIP40\u2014is that the initial resistance of the official statisticians was successfully softened by a combination statistical activism, dialogue, and mediatic echo of the new proposed meas\u2011ure. What motivated the stat\u2011activists was precisely the mismatch between what they per\u2011ceived as a worsening of poverty for segments of the population and the reassuring mes\u2011sage conveyed by the official measures of INSEE.11  Quantitative Storytelling for\u00a0the\u00a0Doing Business IndexThe DBI has been far from uncontroversial. Conceived as a measure of competitiveness, the methodology for its assessment has changed repeatedly over time. New component indicators have been introduced, some topics were removed, and other methodological changes were made. For instance, the 2016 version of the index introduced new component indicators, including the concept of building quality index (in the \u2018dealing with construc\u2011tion permits\u2019 topic), reliability of supply, and transparency of tariff index (\u2018getting electric\u2011ity\u2019 topic). Possibly the most prominent variation in the DBI assessment is the exclusion of the \u2018employing workers\u2019 thematic area from the 2011 edition onwards. As regards meth\u2011odological changes, the component indicator \u2018total tax and contribution rate\u2019 (previously \u2018total tax rate\u2019) is aggregated in a non\u2011linear fashion in the \u2018paying taxes\u2019 area from 2015. The quantity is elevated to the power of 0.8 before the min\u2013max normalisation.These changes in the DBI assessment resulted in variations in ranking for some coun\u2011tries from one edition to the next. For instance, Chile\u2019s performance ranking deteriorated over the two presidencies of Michelle Bachelet. It has been alleged that this was a deliber\u2011ate manoeuvre to discredit the left\u2011wing Bachelet against the mandates of the conservative Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era.When questioned about this result, the then\u2013World Bank chief economist, Paul Romer, objected that the index trend was not the result of any deteriorating performance by Chile; rather, it resulted from the introduction of new component indicators (Talley 2018). In a later blog post, Romer (2018b) clarified that this was not a deliberate move by the World Bank and provided an independent analysis of the data. Thus, Romer argued that the con\u2011troversy was caused merely by insufficient clarity in the World Bank\u2019s communication. The loss of credibility caused by this episode, however, might be one of the reasons why Romer resigned from his duties as World Bank chief economist (Lawder and Wroughton 2018;  M.\u00a0Kuc-Czarnecka et al.1 3Zumbrun 2018). Romer is not an ordinary economist; in the past he demonstrated consid\u2011erable intellectual openness by starting a discussion on the misuse of mathematical models in economics, coining the already mentioned neologism \u2018mathiness\u2019 (2015) to signify the use of mathematics to veil normative stances in growth models.Romer (2018a) applied QST to DBI in an attempt to test the robustness of his collabora\u2011tors\u2019 calculations. He did so by performing a new assessment, in which he included all the CIs available over the period of the study.His objective was to remove the effect of introducing new variables in the computation of the DBI assessment methodology, thus producing more stable and comparable rankings over the years.Romer implemented a Jupyter notebook3 with his calculations, which has been made publicly available on his GitHub repository.4 One of his main findings was that picking only the set of twenty\u2011four component indicators available for the entire period 2014\u20112018 would have produced a less volatile ranking for Chile (Fig.\u00a04). Romer ultimately encour\u2011aged his blog readers to repeat his analysis and evaluate longer trends, rather than ranking annual variations.The prominence of the World Bank and the notoriety of the DBI led various countries to implement economic policies that would target an increase in their DBI score. The fore\u2011word to the 2019 edition states \u2018What gets measured gets done\u2019 and notes: \u2018Since its launch in 2003, Doing Business has inspired more than 3500 reforms in the 10 areas of business regulation measured by the report\u2019.Developing countries are particularly keen to pursue DBI\u2011inspired reforms and to receive the approval of the World Bank, which conceived the DBI for this very purpose. Yet this did not happen without controversy: criticisms of multiple aspects of the DBI were raised in many quarters.For opponents of so\u2011called governance by numbers, the metric strategy pursued by international organizations has led to a deplorable erosion of the law and human condition (Supiot 2015). Berg and Cazes (2007) criticise the political perspective of the DBI in rela\u2011tion to the framework of labour laws, disputing the narrative whereby countries with less Fig. 4  Chile\u2019s world ranking according to its DBI score over the period 2014\u20132018, depending on the accounting methodology (DBI reports vs. Paul Romer\u2019s QST). The charts show four points for each method, rather than five because the figures for 2014 and 2015 overlap3 https ://githu b.com/paulr omer1 49/DB\u2011Calcs /blob/maste r/DB\u2011Calcs .ipynb .4 https ://githu b.com/paulr omer1 49.Quantitative Storytelling in\u00a0the\u00a0Making of\u00a0a\u00a0Composite Indicator 1 3protective labour laws had a higher ranking. According to the authors of the study, a coun\u2011try would be incentivised by the DBI to foster labour market deregulation, whereas the eco\u2011nomic benefits on the ground of such a framework would be questionable. Other authors disputed the normative perspective of some of the component indicators on the country\u2019s employment performance. For instance, Benjamin et\u00a0al. (2010) claim that the component indicators do not adequately map onto the state of labour regulation. These authors sug\u2011gested integrating the assessment performed by the World Bank with other aspects, such as \u2018microlegislation, labour market institutions and juridical interpretation\u2019. The controversy around the deregulation of labour laws contributed to the removal of this thematic area from the DBI assessment from the 2011 edition. From this version onwards, the working employment area is discussed as a separate annexe, in which the dominant narrative is to seek a balance between worker protection and flexibility.More technical criticism of the DBI comes from H\u00f8yland et\u00a0 al. (2012) and Pinheiro\u2011Alves and Zambujal\u2011Oliveira (2012). The former argue that the index completely neglects uncertainty and, with it, possible volatility in the country rankings. The latter argue that the selection of variables in the DBI may be misleading, as several of them do not contribute to variations in the score in the thematic area that they are part of. That is, they are \u2018silent\u2019 in the sense discussed in (Paruolo et\u00a0al. 2013; Saisana et\u00a0al. 2005). This may convey inad\u2011equate information to investors who are scrutinising the countries\u2019 DBI performance.The effect of the different DBI component indicators is discussed by Schueth (2011) who analysed the performance of Georgia according to the DBI and the Global Competi\u2011tiveness Index (GCI). Georgia\u2019s position in the DBI rank has been rising, moving from 100/155 in 2006 to 11/183 in 2010. In the 2019 edition of the DBI report, Georgia ranked sixth out of 190. By contrast, Georgia\u2019s GCI ranking languished: the country was reported to be 85th out of 125 in 2006, and it remained at 90/133 in 2009. Even in the most recent version of the GCI report, Georgia still ranks 66th out of 140. Schueth (2011) argues that this extreme discrepancy in performance can be ascribed to how the different sets of vari\u2011ables included in the indicators capture economic phenomena. This could also be seen as QST setting, whereby a Georgian policy maker who wishes to attract investment to the country would showcase the rapid improvement in Georgia\u2019s DBI ranking; an opposition leader might lament Georgia languishing GCI ranking as a proof of the ineffectiveness of the country\u2019s policies on competitiveness and business friendliness. Doing\u2011business con\u2011troversies lend themselves naturally to QST experiments.12  ConclusionsThe reflections given in this paper in the context of CIs are likely to apply to a much larger set of quantification practices. As Popp Berman and Hirschman (2018) inquire, in the age of algorithms and indicators, \u201cwhat qualities are specific to rankings, or indicators, or mod\u2011els, or algorithms?\u201d In particular, the misuse of metrics, statistical inference, mathematical modelling, and algorithms exhibit some common patterns (Saltelli 2019, 2020).The solution offered here is by no means unique. For example, to address the predica\u2011ment of using fragile mathematical instruments to measure soft concepts, some authors have suggested resorting to the theory of partially ordered sets. This approach offers a syn\u2011thesis of multidimensional indicator systems in which the original variables are not aggre\u2011gated, and the individuals being ranked (e.g. countries or regions or districts; see an exam\u2011ple in Beycan et\u00a0al. (2019); Carlsen and Bruggemann (2014, 2017)) are partially ordered  M.\u00a0Kuc-Czarnecka et al.1 3graphically. This procedure removes the design and modelling choices needed for a CI, such as weights, normalisation, and an aggregation scheme. Partial ordering is thus, by design, more robust than CIs.We focus here on the present generation of CIs, briefly reviewing the existing debates and offering some constructive criticism. In particular, we modify the philosophy of CIs from \u2018analysis cum advocacy\u2019 to \u2018analysis with multiple storytelling\u2019. In other words, we examine a situation in which different stakeholders agree on the importance of evidence and the need to use statistical data while disagreeing on what \u2018the end in sight\u2019 should be, as exemplified in the real world by the  BIP40 story (Bruno et\u00a0al. 2014).Cohesion policy offers a convenient battleground for testing this methodology, as it is clear that multiple definitions of cohesion are possible and desirable, at a moment when a clear overall EU narrative seems elusive (Applebaum 2017).Should measures of fairness or health be part of the portfolio of policies to be targeted by a cohesion policy? Clearly, depending on the answers to these questions, different diag\u2011noses can be produced as to the state and the progress of cohesion.Unsurprisingly, EU countries differ more upon a dimension which we loosely call fair\u2011ness and which includes corruption, political functioning, stability and accountability, reg\u2011ulatory quality, and the rule of law.EU countries become more equal when health care is included, but at the same time, this equality is eroded by the recent onset of a divergence trend.The case of the Doing Business shows that, in practice, some sort of multiple\u2011frame analysis\u2014what we call quantitative storytelling\u2014is already taking place under pressure from stakeholders. This contributed to variation in the structure of the underpinning the\u2011matic areas in the DBI over the years. The most prominent of them is the exclusion from the 2011 edition of the index of a controversial thematic area such as \u2018employing workers\u2019. The primary role played by stakeholders is also reflected by the fact the DBI is simultane\u2011ously a measure and a target proposed to developing countries. For this reason, the danger of the Goodhart (or Campbell) Law\u2014that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure as \u2018players\u2019 start adapting to it (Muller 2018), has been contrasted by scholars and stakeholders alike, signalling a mismatch between the measure and the desir\u2011ability of the resulting policy.13  Software and\u00a0DataSoftware and data used for the present work can be retrieved at the GitHub repository https ://githu b.com/Confa reneo class ico/Quant itati ve_story telli ng_makin g_compo site_indic atorAcknowledgements Marta Kuc\u2011Czarnecka participation in this project is financed by National Science Centre Poland, research grant MINIATURA 2, research topic \u201cRegional social convergence in the European Union\u201d, 2018/02/X/HS4/00082.Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Com\u2011mons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

Introduction The number of diabetes sufferers has been increasing. In 2014, globally, 422 million people were living with diabetes, compared with 108 million in 1980, according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2016). Diabetes is a metabolic disorder affecting blood glucose levels, which can have serious consequences, including cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy and diabetic foot (Struijs et al., 2006; WHO, 2016). The majority of diabetes patients are affected by type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which mainly occurs among adults and is associated with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and obesity (Kahn et al., 2006).  Growing evidence suggests the association between insulin resistance and several clinical conditions, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) (Pauli et al., 2011), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Ballestri et al., 2016),  various cancers (Malaguarnera et al., 2017; Vona-Davis et al., 2007)  and their complications (e.g.  muscle wasting cachexia (Honors and Kinzig, 2012)). In addition, epidemiological evidence Journal Pre-proof 2 suggests that people with diabetes are at an increased risk for cognitive decline, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Gudala et al., 2013; Ninomiya, 2014; Ojo and Brooke, 2015), indicating the importance of diabetes management in the ageing population.  Due to the increasing prevalence and chronic nature, T2DM is a global health issue of significant economic importance. According to American Diabetes Association (ADA), the direct medical cost in 2012 was $176 billion in the United States, and average medical expenditure on a diabetes patient was about $13,700 per year: approximately 2.3 times higher than the estimate in the absence of diabetes (ADA, 2013). In Europe, a study comprising 8 countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) revealed the cost of T2DM to be \u20ac 29 billion a year (1999 values) and the estimated average yearly cost \u20ac 2834 per patient (J\u00f6nsson B and Board., 2002). In Germany alone, average annual direct cost of medical care was \u20ac 5,262, approximately 1.9 times higher compared with costs of age- and sex-matched non-diabetic control subjects (K\u00f6ster et al., 2006). Although some of the top-selling medications such as metformin are modestly priced and drug costs for managing T2DM are relatively low (7% of the total healthcare costs for T2DM) (J\u00f6nsson B and Board., 2002), the exploration of blood glucose management using traditional herbal medicines is warranted as it could help prevent the development of T2DM and comorbidities, thereby reducing the direct and indirect costs. Current anti-diabetic drugs such as sulfonylureas and \uf061-glucosidase inhibitors help manage blood glucose levels.  However, due to potential side effects such as nausea, dyspepsia and weight gain (Sola et al., 2015; van de Laar, 2008), it is important to find effective and safer alternatives.   The medicinal properties of cinnamon have been acknowledged since antiquity (De Vos, 2010). The genus Cinnamomum (Lauraceae) includes more than 250 species, among which Cinnamomum verum J.Presl (synonym: C. zeylanicum Blume, Ceylon cinnamon or true cinnamon) and C. cassia (L.) J.Presl (synonym: C. aromaticum Nees, cassia cinnamon or Chinese cinnamon) are most commonly used as medicines (Nabavi et al., 2015). The inner bark is used as a circulatory stimulant, a digestive aid, diaphoretic, and antitussive (Bone and Journl Pre-proof 3 Mills, 2013; Klein and Rister, 1993). Historically, C. cassia is among the top 14 \u2018simples\u2019 (plants that can be used on their own for medicinal purposes, rather than as part of a formula) listed in 12 important texts including Hippocratic Corpus  (5th -4th century BC), De Materia Medica by Dioscorides (1st century AD), The Canon of Medicine (volume 2) by Avicenna (980 \u2013 1037 AD), and Farmacopea Espanola (1865), while C. verum is one of the top 26 simples, listed in 11 out of the 12 texts (De Vos, 2010). In The Canon of Medicine, Cinnamomum spp. was among 18 plants that protect the liver from injuries or diseases, and recent studies confirmed the hepatoprotective effect of Cinnamomum spp. using animal models (Shamsi-Baghbanan et al., 2014). In a 15th-century French herbal \u2018Le Livre des Simples Medecines\u2019, cinnamon was among the six medicinal spices (pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace). The text states that cinnamon is used \u2018for weakness of the stomach and liver and to help digestion weakened by cold\u2019, \u2018to restore appetite\u2019, \u2018for recently cracked lips and other sores\u2019, and \u2018for heart ailments and syncope\u2019 (Nam, 2014). In fact, the use of cinnamon to treat digestive tract ailments has continued throughout history (De Vos, 2010). The European Medicine Agency (EMA) endorses the traditional use of C. verum for symptomatic treatment of mild, spasmodic gastro-intestinal complaints (EMA, 2011b). At present, cinnamon is on the market as a prophylactic supplement for metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, T2DM, hyperlipidaemia, and arthritis (Medagama, 2015; Rafehi et al., 2012).  The major constituents of cinnamon include cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl acetate, eugenol, catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidins (Chen et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014; Kaul et al., 2003; Vallverd\u00fa-Queralt et al., 2014). A number of potential mechanisms for cinnamon have been suggested (Rafehi et al., 2012), including activation of phosphorylation of insulin receptors \uf062-subunits; increased expression of GLUT 4, increase in GLUT 1 mediated glucose uptake, increase in GLP-1, increase in PPAR, inhibition of intestinal \uf061-glucosidase and pancreatic \uf061-amylase, inhibition of gluconeogenesis, and delay of gastric emptying. Preclinical studies demonstrated hypoglycaemic and hypolipidaemic properties of Journal Pr-proof 4 cinnamon extract and the active constituents (Medagama, 2015). In vivo studies found improved insulin sensitivity and lowered intestinal carbohydrate absorption after the treatment with cinnamon extract in T2DM model mice (Kim et al., 2006), a reduction of plasma glucose levels by cinnamaldehyde via insulin secretion from pancreatic \uf062-cells (Subash Babu et al., 2007), insulin-like activity of cinnamon polyphenols (trimers and tetramers of catechin and epicatechin) (Anderson et al., 2004), blood glucose-lowering effects of polyphenol-enriched C. verum extract (IM et al., 2014b) and polyphenol-enriched de-coumarinated C. cassia extract (IM et al., 2014a), and lowered triglyceride and total cholesterol levels after treatment with cinnamon extract in T2DM model mice (Kim et al., 2006). PPAR-\uf067 and \uf061 activation in adipocytes (Sheng et al., 2008) and up-regulation of anti-inflammatory factors such as tristetraprolin and glucose transporter (GLUT1) in macrophages were also suggested in vitro (Cao et al., 2008). Using C. verum, Kadan et al. demonstrated a significant gain in GLUT4 on the cell surface of muscle cells, suggesting that C. verum could facilitate glucose uptake into skeletal muscle (Kadan et al., 2013). Considering that glycemic fluctuations and hyperglycemia trigger endothelial dysfunction and inflammation (Mannucci et al., 2013), controlling hyperglycemia is likely to reduce the risk of atherogenesis and cardiovascular events. In addition, hyperglycemia and abnormal insulin levels are related to an increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease as well as vascular dementia (Gudala et al., 2013; Matsuzaki et al., 2010; R\u00f6nnemaa et al., 2008; Young et al., 2006). Therefore, the hypoglycaemic property of cinnamon may protect against diabetes-related comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases and dementia.  The EMA states that cinnamon bark contains up to 4% of essential oil consisting primarily of cinnamaldehyde (60-75%) (EMA, 2011a). Herbal preparations equivalent to 2-4g cinnamon per day, or 50-200mg of essential oil, are indicated for symptomatic treatment of mild spasmodic gastrointestinal complaints including bloating and flatulence (EMA, 2011b). C. cassia has traditional use similar to C. verum, however the two species have differences in their constituents as summarised elsewhere (Ranasinghe et al., 2013): C. verum bark oil Jourl Pre-proof 5 contains 49.9\u201362.8% trans-cinnamaldehyde while C. cassia contains almost 95% cinnamaldehyde. In addition, it is notable that C. cassia contains coumarin up to 1% (Krieger et al., 2013), whereas C. verum contains coumarin only at trace or undetectable levels (Krieger et al., 2013; Ranasinghe et al., 2013). Considering that o-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (o-HPA), a metabolite of coumarin, is hepatotoxic, long-term consumption of C. cassia may pose a health risk (Abraham et al., 2010; Ranasinghe et al., 2013), while C. verum would likely be free of this particular risk (Medagama, 2015). Therefore it has been suggested that C. verum should be used in preference to C. cassia in treating T2DM (Medagama, 2015).  Five reviews have examined the efficacy of cinnamon species for diabetes (Table 1). A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in 2012 (Leach and Kumar, 2012) assessed ten RCTs published between 2003 and 2010. The authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of cinnamon as an anti-diabetes mellitus treatment. On the other hand, systematic review and meta-analysis by Akilen et al. (2012) found a significant decrease in HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels (Akilen et al., 2012). A year later, In 2013, a meta-analysis (Allen et al., 2013) found significant improvement in fasting blood glucose levels as well as in lipid parameters, although no significant effect was found on HbA1c levels. Another meta-analysis (Alanazi and Khan, 2015)  reflected the findings of Allen et al. (2013). Medagama (2015) found improved glycaemic control in T2DM patients without other medications as well as those with pre-diabetes and high pre-treatment HbA1c. Medagama concluded that cinnamon is potentially useful as an adjuvant therapy in managing T2DM. The difference in conclusions between those reviews is interesting, ranging from insufficient evidence to a useful add on treatment. Of note, none of these reviews separately assessed the different cinnamon species. Overall this suggests the evidence for effective intervention in T2DM is growing, but provisional, given the heterogeneity of cinnamon species, preparations, and dosages.    The herbal CONSORT statement (Gagnier et al., 2006) considers it \u201cimperative that reports of RCTs provide clear and complete descriptions of the herbal intervention\u201d, Journal Pr-proof 6 including the Latin binomial name together with botanical authority and family name in addition to common names for each herbal ingredient.  If the species is unspecified it is difficult to establish causality. Given the potential confusion, substitution or adulteration of herbal products, (Fong, 2002; Posadzki et al., 2012), this review focuses on interventions using two named cinnamon species: C. cassia and C. verum.  While Medagama discussed the safety issue of high coumarin content in C cassia, suggesting C. verum syn zeylanicum as a safer alternative, none of the five reviews evaluated the differential efficacy of the two main medicinal cinnamon species and their dosages as a T2DM intervention and whether the coumarin content of these species is a cause for concern. Furthermore, these reviews did not assess the differential evidence for the suitability of the two cinnamon species for related clinical conditions, nor the effect of the two cinnamon species on blood sugar related parameters in healthy populations. Hence, this study seeks to review the current evidence for C. cassia and C. verum in the treatment of T2DM and metabolically related conditions, their effects on blood sugar related parameters in healthy populations, and their safety profile.   2. Methods 2.1 Database searching for clinical evidence The current review focuses on trials investigating the effects of C. verum and C. cassia on the levels of blood glucose and other relevant parameters in diabetes management. To consider prophylactic benefits and effectiveness in the management of diabetes, trials on T2DM patients, as well as subjects with other related clinical conditions and healthy individuals, were reviewed.  Search strategy To find clinical evidence for the anti-diabetic effects of C. verum and C. cassia, searches were conducted using databases, namely PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect. Studies were included in the current review if they were published between 2000 up to April 2018 and met the inclusion criteria below. PubMed/Medline searches were conducted for Jornal Pre-proof 7 article type \u2018Clinical Trial\u2019, using search terms \u2018Cinnamomum verum\u2019 and its botanical synonym \u2018Cinnamomum zeylanicum\u2019, \u2018Cinnamomum cassia\u2019, and its botanical synonym \u2018Cinnamomum aromaticum\u2019. The same terms were used for searching in Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect. For ScienceDirect, searches were refined by selecting \u2018Abstract, Title, Keywords\u2019 and categories of \u2018Nursing and Dentistry\u2019, \u2018Nursing and Health Professions\u2019, \u2018Pharmacology\u2019, and \u2018Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science\u2019.  Inclusion criteria: 1. Original study  2. Focusing on the effect of either C. verum or C. cassia (not in combination with other herbs or nutrients) in controlling blood glucose levels or other parameters relevant to diabetes management or related clinical conditions  3. Published in English  4. Controlled Publications not meeting the above criteria, as well as studies using unspecified or different cinnamon species, or combination products, were excluded.  Each author assessed the final selection of studies independently, before final agreement on inclusion.  2.2 Coumarin content and safety issues To assess coumarin contents and potential toxicity of cinnamon species, database searches were conducted for journal articles using the combination of 2 keywords, namely coumarin and either C. verum or C. cassia. PubMed searches were conducted using the following search terms: (1) (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) AND coumarin, (2) (Cinnamomum verum) AND coumarin, (3) (Cinnamomum cassia) AND coumarin, and (4) (Cinnamomum aromaticum) AND coumarin, for publication from 1971 to November 2017. For ScienceDirect, the same term combinations were searched in abstract, title, and keywords. Searches were conducted on 2017 Dec 1-3. Papers were screened by title and abstract, and then selected for reviewing if it contained quantitative information about the contents of coumarins or safety issues of either C. verum or C. cassia. Journal Pre-proof 8  3. Results and Discussions There are 3 most common ways to detect diabetic and prediabetic conditions: fasting blood glucose, HbA1c levels, and glucose tolerance (ADA, 2010; Patel and Macerollo, 2010). HbA1c test is a blood test that provides the average blood glucose over the past 3 months. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) measures glucose tolerance by measuring blood glucose after fasting and after glucose intake. Trials reviewed in this study assessed the effectiveness of cinnamon in T2DM patients using these and related parameters, as well as the effect of C. cassia and C. verum on related conditions and healthy populations.   3.1 Cinnamon for diabetes management A total of 12 database searches (4 for each database: PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library) were conducted using the 4 search terms, and 308 results were obtained. There were 67 results (39 from PubMed, 21 from ScienceDirect, and 7 from Cochrane Library) for \u2018Cinnamomum verum, 121 results (38 from PubMed, 37 from ScienceDirect, and 46 from Cochrane Library) for \u2018Cinnamomum zeylanicum\u2019, 100 results (10 from PubMed, 78 from ScienceDirect, and 12 from Cochrane Library) for \u2018Cinnamomum cassia\u2019, and 20 results (7 from PubMed, 6 from ScienceDirect, and 7 from Cochrane Library) for \u2018Cinnamomum aromaticum\u2019. After removing duplicates and screening from title and abstract, 32 articles remained. Seven studies were removed, three due to the lack of information on the cinnamon species used in the trials (Altschuler et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2010; Mirfeizi et al., 2016); three using a different species: C.burmanii as the formulation CinSulin (Anderson et al., 2016; Roussel et al., 2009; Ziegenfuss et al., 2006); one using a combination product including zinc gluconate (Wainstein et al., 2011). The remaining 25 studies of 997 participants were selected for reviewing (Table 1).  The selection process is presented in a flowchart (Figure 1).   Fifteen studies were conducted on T2DM patients, among which twelve trials used C. cassia (Akilen et al., 2010; Blevins et al., 2007; Crawford, 2009; Gullapalli et al., 2013; Journl Pe-proof 9 Hasanzade et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2012; Mang et al., 2006; Sengsuk et al., 2016; Soni and Bhatnagar, 2009; Suppapitiporn et al., 2006; Vanschoonbeek et al., 2006)  (n=730) and three trials used C. verum (Azimi et al., 2014; Azimi et al., 2016; Vafa et al., 2012) (n=123).  Dosages were 1-3g per day, and durations of the trials ranged from 30 days to four months. Reduction in fasting blood glucose or other diabetes-related parameters were demonstrated in ten studies (C. cassia 1.5-6g per day for 40 days - four months, or C. verum 3g per day for 8 weeks) (Akilen et al., 2010; Azimi et al., 2014; Azimi et al., 2016; Crawford, 2009; Gullapalli et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2012; Mang et al., 2006; Sengsuk et al., 2016; Soni and Bhatnagar, 2009), and a study showed postprandial blood glucose decrease after 40-day administration of C. cassia (2g per day) (Soni and Bhatnagar, 2009). On the other hand, four studies found no significant effect on fasting blood glucose levels after 1-1.5g C. cassia administration for 30 days \u2013 three months (Blevins et al., 2007; Hasanzade et al., 2013; Suppapitiporn et al., 2006; Vanschoonbeek et al., 2006). Four studies (n=82) were conducted on subjects with other clinical conditions such as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), high fasting or postload blood glucose levels and obesity. Among these studies, three trials used C. cassia (Gutierrez et al., 2016; Magistrelli and Chezem, 2012; Wickenberg et al., 2014) (n=72) and one trial used C. verum (Wickenberg et al., 2012) (n=10). Three trials were conducted on postprandial glucose levels using an oral glucose tolerance test with cinnamon intake at the test (Gutierrez et al., 2016; Wickenberg et al., 2012; Magistrelli and Chezem, 2012). Intake of C. cassia 5-6g reduced postprandial glucose levels in obese individuals (Gutierrez et al., 2016; Magistrelli and Chezem, 2012), while C. verum 6g had no effect in IGT patients (Wickenberg et al., 2012). Twelve-week oral administration of 12g of C. cassia had no effect on insulin sensitivity, fasting blood glucose or HbA1c (Wickenberg et al., 2014). Six studies were conducted on 84 healthy subjects, among which four trials used C. cassia (Hlebowicz et al., 2009; Mettler et al., 2009; Solomon and Blannin, 2007, 2009) and two trials used C. verum (Beejmohun et al., 2014; Markey et al., 2011). Five OGTT studies were conducted with C. cassia or C. verum (Beejmohun et al., 2014; Hlebowicz et al., 2009; Markey et al., 2011; Mettler et al., 2009; Solomon and Blannin, Jurnl Pr -proof 10 2007) and one study looked at postprandial glucose and insulin levels after 14-day administration of C. cassia (Solomon and Blannin, 2009). Positive outcomes were obtained in the trials using C. cassia (3-5g) (Hlebowicz et al., 2009; Mettler et al., 2009; Solomon and Blannin, 2007, 2009), and 1g alcoholic extract of C. verum (Beejmohun et al., 2014). However, C. verum 3g had no effect on postprandial glucose and lipid levels after a high fat meal (Markey et al., 2011).  3.1.1 T2DM: C. cassia and C. verum compared (Table 2-1)  Out of 15 studies on T2DM patients, 12 used C. cassia and three used C. verum. Of these 15 studies, ten reported significant improvements with a variety of outcome measures including HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose and insulin as well as the patho-metabolically related parameters of blood pressure. Eight of these ten positive outcomes were from the 12 C. cassia studies (Akilen et al., 2010; Blevins et al., 2007; Crawford, 2009; Gullapalli et al., 2013; Hasanzade et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2012; Mang et al., 2006; Sengsuk et al., 2016; Soni and Bhatnagar, 2009; Suppapitiporn et al., 2006; Vanschoonbeek et al., 2006) and the remaining positive outcomes were two of the three C. verum studies (Azimi et al., 2014; Vafa et al., 2012). Furthermore, C. cassia 1.5-6g per day, aqueous extract 120-360 mg per day for 40 days \u2013 three months, or C. verum 3g per day for eight weeks reduced triglyceride and LDL levels in T2DM patients (Khan et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2012; Sengsuk et al., 2016). Considering that body fat is a significant diabetes-associated risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Howard et al., 2000), C. cassia and C. verum may help prevent the development of vascular comorbidity in T2DM.  Five studies (Azimi et al., 2016; Blevins et al., 2007; Hasanzade et al., 2013; Suppapitiporn et al., 2006; Vanschoonbeek et al., 2006) reported no improvements in the analysed outcome measures including fasting glucose levels and HbA1c.  Four of these were C. cassia studies (Blevins et al., 2007; Hasanzade et al., 2013; Suppapitiporn et al., 2006; Vanschoonbeek et al., 2006) and one was a C. verum study (Azimi et al., 2016). The dosages for three of C. cassia studies were 1g per day (Blevins et al., 2007; Hasanzade et al., 2013), and 1.5g per day (Suppapitiporn et al., 2006; Journal Pre-proof 11 Vanschoonbeek et al., 2006).  These dosages are low compared to the most commonly used dosage of 3g per day. In addition, the duration in the Hasanzade study was 30 days (Hasanzade et al., 2013), which is likely too short to meaningfully assess changes in HbA1c levels, an outcome measure used in the study. Administration of 3g per day for eight weeks showed no improvement in a study (Azimi et al., 2016), which measured blood pressure and endothelial function in T2DM rather than direct blood glucose parameters. This is relevant considering the relationship between poor blood glucose control and hypertension via the development of atherosclerosis may take longer to modify than eight weeks that was provided in the trial. Interestingly, when the same authors reported fasting blood glucose as the outcome measure on this study, a decrease was found (Azimi et al., 2014), suggesting it is easier to modify this parameter with C. verum than its downstream effects. Both publications (Azimi et al., 2014; Azimi et al., 2016) refer to different datasets within the same study of four individual herbal interventions, including C. verum 3g/day.   3.1.2 Related Clinical Conditions: C. cassia and C. verum compared (Table 2-2)  Four studies were conducted on subjects with clinical conditions other than T2DM: IGT (Wickenberg et al., 2012; Wickenberg et al., 2014) as a pre-diabetic condition,  and obesity (Gutierrez et al., 2016; Magistrelli and Chezem, 2012), which is a risk factor for diabetes.  In obese subjects, ingestion of C. cassia 5g and 6g suppressed postprandial glucose rise (Gutierrez et al., 2016; Magistrelli and Chezem, 2012).. In a study with IGT participants, Wickenberg et al. found no impact of C. cassia 12g per day for 12 weeks on the fasting glucose and insulin levels (Wickenberg et al., 2014). These findings suggest the potential effectiveness of C. cassia at 5g-6g per day, but not as high as 12g per day for the prevention of T2DM development in individuals with high risk. Turning to C. verum, Wickenberg also authored a study on C. verum, and found no effect of C. verum 6g on postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels (Wickenberg et al., 2012).     Jurnal Pre-proof 12 3.1.3 Healthy: C. cassia and C. verum compared (Table 2-3)  A study on healthy subjects found that postprandial insulin rise was suppressed by 3g C. cassia but not by 1g (Hlebowicz et al., 2009), suggesting that the critical dosage of C. cassia lies between 1 and 3 g per day. Single administration of C. cassia (3g or 5g) (Hlebowicz et al., 2009; Solomon and Blannin, 2007) and C. cassia (3g) for 14 days (Solomon and Blannin, 2009) led to decrease in postprandial glucose response. Mettler et al. reported that C. cassia 4g had a significant impact on postprandial glucose levels only when taken in combination with acetic acid (Mettler et al., 2009). Interestingly, in the historical text \u2018Le Livre des Simples Medecines\u2019, combination of cinnamon with vinegar is suggested for its effectiveness (Nam, 2014). These data suggest that C. cassia powder 3g or C. cassia taken with vinegar, could help control blood glucose levels and associated parameters, which may be of benefit to T2DM patients.  In two C. verum studies in healthy populations, ingestion of an alcoholic extract (1g) of C. verum led to a reduction in postprandial glucose and insulin levels (Beejmohun et al., 2014), while ingestion of a dose of C. verum 3g with a high fat meal (Markey et al., 2011) did not influence postprandial changes in glucose and triacylglycerol levels.  Overall, C. cassia (\u2265 3g) in healthy individuals had positive outcomes in postprandial glucose control, while evidence supporting C. verum is insufficient.  3.2 Safety issues 3.2.1 Adverse events in the clinical trials Ten studies positively reported no adverse events.  Fourteen studies did not report whether or not any adverse events occurred during the studies.  One study reported a subject developing a rash (Crawford, 2009).  Another study (Wickenberg et al., 2014), using 12g/day C .cassia for 12 weeks, whilst not actively reporting adverse events, did measure liver enzymes, and found no change in serum transaminases.  3.2.2 Coumarin and safety (Table 3) Journal Pre-proof 13 Due to the high coumarin content of C. cassia, C. verum has been suggested to be a safe alternative intervention for diabetes (Medagama, 2015). Coumarin (2H-chromen-2-one) is a naturally occurring constituent of many plants, and long term use of cinnamon as a flavouring agent is generally considered safe (Leach and Kumar, 2012).  It was first isolated from tonga beans Dipteryx odorata (Aubl.) Willd. in 1820 and chemically synthesized coumarin had been marketed as a food flavouring agent for a long time until its hepatotoxic potential was discovered in laboratory animals in the middle of the 20th century. From the 1970s, coumarin was approved as a medicine to treat oedemas as well as tumours in several countries. However some patients developed severe hepatotoxicity, which led to the withdrawal of products from the market in 1990s (Abraham et al., 2010). Coumarin is metabolized via two major pathways: detoxification by 7-hydroxylation and the formation of 3,4-epoxide intermediate, the latter of which leads to the generation of a hepatotoxic metabolite o-HPA. As the 7-hydroxyation pathway is predominant in primates including humans, humans are less susceptible to coumarin hepatotoxicity compared to rodents. However, clinical data revealed that a human population subgroup reacts sensitively to coumarin (Loprinzi et al., 1999; Schmeck-Lindenau et al., 2003), although the underlying mechanism is unknown (Abraham et al., 2010).   To evaluate the coumarin-related safety issues of the two cinnamon species, database searches were conducted. The search retrieved a total of 19 results (18 results for PubMed, 1 for ScienceDirect), of which five articles are selected and summarised in Table 3. Abraham et al. (2011) compared the absorption of coumarin after oral administration of isolated coumarin and C. cassia in different preparations (capsules, tea, and rice pudding) (Abraham et al., 2011). They found that coumarin in isolation and in C. cassia were equally absorbed, and that C. cassia tea exhibited the fastest and highest coumarin absorption, compared to capsules and rice pudding. Data on the coumarin contents in different cinnamon species confirmed higher coumarin levels in C. cassia compared to C. verum (Table 3). Three independent studies conducted on the coumarin levels of C. cassia reported considerably different values: 2.57\u00b10.08g/kg (2.512\u20132.628 g/kg) (Krieger et al., 2013), 0.201\u00b10.104 g/kg (0.085-0.310g/kg) Jurnal Pr-proof 14 (Wang et al., 2013), and 1.60\u00b11.70g/kg (0.33-6.5 g/kg) (Lv et al., 2010), which could be due to several factors including extraction methods, analytical methods, and the sources of plant materials. In fact, those studies were conducted using different extraction and analytical methods, namely 80% methanol extraction without heat or sonication and LC-MS and DIP-APCI-MS analyses (Krieger et al., 2013), methanol extraction with sonication and UPLC-UV/MS (Wang et al., 2013), and pressurized liquid extraction with ethyl acetate at 160\u00b0C and and GC-MS (Lv et al., 2010), which could underlie the variability in these studies. Furthermore, plant materials were obtained from different sources, such as German retail market (Krieger et al., 2013), commercial source in China and the United States (Wang et al., 2013), and different regions of China (Lv et al., 2010). As demonstrated by Lv et al., coumarin contents of C. cassia could considerably vary (from 0.33 to 6.50 mg/g) depending on the geographical origins (Lv et al., 2010), which is likely due to different climatic conditions, plant age, and harvest timings. In addition, coumarin levels could vary depending on which plant parts were used. A study compared the levels of coumarin and other constituents in the bark, shaved bark (without cork layer), and twig of C. cassia, both used in traditional East Asian medicines, and found that coumarin in cinnamon twig was less than one-third compared to cinnamon bark, and shaved cinmmamon bark contained the highest levels of coumarin (Chen et al., 2016). Importantly, a study showed that a de-coumarinated polyphenol-enriched C. cassia extract, prepared using a novel procedure, was effective in lowering blood glucose levels in T2DM rats (IM et al., 2014a), indicating that the selection of extraction procedure could significantly enhance the safety of C. cassia. Of note, C. burmannii (Nees & T. Nees) Blume, commonly also known as \u2018cassia\u2019 cinnamon (Avula et al., 2015), has characteristically high coumarin levels, which is distinct from C. cassia (Avula et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013), and C. burmannii was likely referred to as \u2018cassia\u2019 cinnamon in some reports. Importantly, Wang et al. reported that C. cassia contains higher levels of cinnamaldehyde: C. cassia (18.5\u00b12.9 g/kg, n=4) > C. verum (11.2\u00b15.5 g/kg, n=17) (Wang et al., 2013). Considering that anti-diabetic actions of cinnamon is at least partly mediated by cinnamaldehyde (Li et al., 2012), the dosage of C. verum should be carefully Journl Pe-proof 15 considered as a replacement for C. cassia. In fact, short-term administration (\uf0a3 14days) of C. verum (3g and 6g) were ineffective (Markey et al., 2011; Wickenberg et al., 2012), while C. cassia 3 - 6 g were effective (Hlebowicz et al., 2009; Magistrelli and Chezem, 2012; Mettler et al., 2009; Solomon and Blannin, 2007), suggesting that C. cassia has higher potency compared to C. verum. Overall, it is important to identify botanical origin, geographical origin, plant parts, and extraction procedures, in using and reporting analytical as well as clinical trial data. In addition to liver damage caused by coumarin, allergic reactions should be considered as a possible adverse effect, as several cases of contact dermatitis have been reported (Ackermann et al., 2009; Calapai et al., 2014; Isaac-Renton et al., 2015). In fact, a subject developed a rash after consuming C. cassia 1g per day in a trial (Crawford, 2009), however this was the only adverse reaction reported in any of the trials considered in this review. In fact, no case reports of interactions were identified therefore it was considered unlikely that it would affect the effectiveness of conventional drugs (Edwards et al., 2015). However, pharmacovigilance is important for any potential interactions and additive effects.   Both C. verum and C. cassia, in therapeutic doses, should be avoided during pregnancy (Edwards et al., 2015; Gardner and McGuffin, 2013).  3.3 Limitation of the study Due to the scarcity of available data, this study included both randomised placebo-controlled and open-label trials. In addition, compared to C. cassia, only a few trials have been conducted with C. verum. This is limiting as the discussion is  based on evidence supported by a small number of studies with less vigorous study designs. More robust studies are needed in the future.  3.4 Concluding remarks Journal Pre-proof 16 Most clinical studies were conducted using C. cassia, which was originally used as an anti-diabetic medicine and listed as the unique origin of \u2018Cortex cinnamomi\u2019 in the Chinese pharmacopoeia (Lv et al., 2010). Evidence suggests that oral administration of C. cassia 3-6g per day could improve glucose metabolism in T2DM patients and healthy individuals, while effectiveness was inconsistent below 1.5g. However, heterogeneity in the methods used in the trials as well as quality issues including lack of botanical authentication compromise the evidence for the efficacy and safety.   Therapeutic potency depends on the levels of active constituents. Considering that medicinal plants in general contain a number of bioactive compounds, the levels of which could be affected by many factors such as geographical origin, plant parts, and crude drug processing, it is important to assess the chemical properties of botanical medicines before using and evaluating the therapeutic potency and safety. In addition, due to the high coumarin content of C. cassia, future trials should be designed taking into account the assessment of potential hepatotoxicity by including liver function tests over suitable trial durations. These efforts would allow a more reliable safety and efficacy evaluation of C. cassia. as a diabetes intervention.   On the other hand, data are scarce and inconclusive for the effectiveness of C. verum. It should be noted that the interchangeability of the two cinnamon species as a diabetes intervention is not established and there is currently no standardisation method for quality control. It is important for practitioners to consider possible differences in the potency between the two species as well as within the same species, and potential risk associated with coumarin consumption. Given the low coumarin content of C. verum there is an opportunity for more robust RCTs, of longer duration and larger participant numbers giving greater power, to investigate whether this species has potential for this growing patient group. The effective and safe dosage practices for different species should be built on scientific data through careful examination and comparison, as well as drawing on long-standing traditional usages. Key to this is clarity about the intervention including establishing botanical authenticity. Such work could not only benefit T2DM patients and those diagnosed as pre-Journal Pre-proof 17 diabetic, but also the growing number of diseases that are related to insulin resistance, and hence favourably ameliorate the personal, social and economic costs of these conditions.
